The rise of Continous Integration and Continuous Delivery practices in the Infrastructure world has been so important that the expression DevOps Engineer is often used to describe CI/CD Engineering. The DevOps Stack takes advantage of the CI/CD approach to make changes seamless, both at the provisioning and deployment levels. The underlying infrastructure which sets up the Kubernetes Cluster underneath the DevOps Stack is managed with Terraform. It is strongly encouraged to use a CI/CD approach to manage this Terraform deployment, and the DevOps Stack provides a set of scripts to integrate pair-reviewed change process on your CI/CD platform of choice. See the Quickstarts section to see how to get started with your Cloud of choice. On top of Kubernetes, the DevOps Stack sets up Argo CD to continuously deploy all applications to the cluster. Argo CD monitors Kubernetes resources and can keep them synchronized with their target state. The cluster applications deployed by Argo CD can easily be tuned to fit your needs.

In particular, in the context of Cloud resources, it allows to make sure all resources are managed centrally and destroyed in their proper context. This is important to control the financial consequences of numerous deployments. The DevOps Stack is strongly founded on the idea that every one of its components should be managed as code: - The underlying Kubernetes cluster and its components are managed with Terraform - The Cluster Applications are deployed using Helm charts orchestrated by Argo CD This allows you to keep track of all changes made at any level of the Stack, using Continuous Deployment in a GitOps approach.

One way to do this, which seems to be used more and more, is to talk about \"days\". To make it very simple, here are some explanations: Day 0 is related to software development, questions about requirements, architecture and design. Day 1 is more about deploying software developed in the Day 0 and starting to build and configure the hosting infrastructure. Day 2 is the time to go live and hope that the efforts made in Day 1 are adequate. This is a crucial moment, when it is imperative to have metrics, monitoring, tools and best practices to do efficient troubleshooting. For now, the DevOps Stack is very focused on the points relating to days 1 and 2. In particular, the aspects related to the provisioning of a Kubernetes platform as well as the mandatory services related to its operational management. We must also take into account that using the Cloud and Cloud Native development practices make it much easier to handle changes related to software life cycle. The boundaries and responsibilities between these different phases have become more blurred, less strict. In the near future, we really want to invest significantly in aspects related to day 0 by improving the DevOps Stack in that direction, especially the software factory and development best practices related to Kubernetes integration. This is closely linked to the generalization of the Twelve-Factor App methodology, as well as breaking silos and embracing DevOps principles. These good practices should be applied as early as possible in projects. It is absolutely necessary. The DevOps Stack provisions our k8s cluster with a set of administration and monitoring tools out-of-the-box. Here below some of the services' dashboards. Whether you use AKS, EKS, or your local workstation using k3s, the DevOps Stack provisions the cluster with an Identity and Access Manager. For the case of a local k3s cluster, the DevOps Stack spawns a Keyclaok instance (for more plase see authentication references).

This new way of managing IT resources is widely known as \"Cloud Computing\". It has become a kind of standard, or at least an objective pursued also by people wishing to maintain on-premises infrastructures. The long-awaited dream of finally being able to consider IT as a simple commodity. Well that’s what many believed. The concrete consequences of this revolution for IT companies like Camptocamp have mainly been the incredible growth in the number of resources to be provisioned and managed. Extensive process automation engaged by our teams allowed us to cope with such a growth without lowering our quality standards, therefore remaining competitive. We had no respite in this automation journey and made the best out of a thriving ecosystem of open source projects that address all the needs related to this paradigm shift. We have learned a lot during all these years and the DevOps Stack is our answer to implement our best practices in a containerized world where Kubernetes is the de facto standard for application platforms. Nowadays, the question is not so much whether there is software to solve a problem, but which one to use. Like a Linux distribution, we have container orchestrators (Kubernetes as a kernel) and many other projects revolving around it and offering different features. These features are sometimes oriented towards developers, operators or both (e.g. observability tools). As for a Linux distribution, what we need is consistency, components that work together and that are easy to install and maintain. But unlike a Linux distribution which is by definition server-centric, the promise of containers and Kubernetes is portability. The possibility of moving from one cloud (or on-prem infrastructure) to another, of distributing the workloads on different platforms. At the end, this DevOps Stack is simply a \"Cloud Agnostic Kubernetes Distribution\". The illustration above tries to show that while it is quite simple to manage one Kubernetes project, the complexity increases dramatically when you add more and more projects and you want to keep a certain homogeneity between them. The main problems observed are: It does not scale There is a lot of code duplications There is no implementation reference Improvements are not always backported to other projects It is very hard to maintain All projects will eventually diverge Each project points to different versions of dependencies This is not a new IT problem. Two decades ago, it was not really easy to manage thousands, or even hundreds of hosts in a homogeneous way. This problem has been successfully addressed by solutions like CFEngine, Puppet or more recently by Ansible. Today, we must adapt these principles for Kubernetes. There are many open source components out there, we just need a smart way to interconnect them. By creating the DevOps Stack (a kind of abstraction layer), it becomes possible to instantiate all the components through a logical and coherent process. The main advantages are: It scales Minimal code duplication A reference implementation Improvements can be easily backported to other projects Dependency pining is done on the DevOps Stack to ensure reproducibility In the end, the DevOps Stack provides: A Playground to test/prototype new stuff related to k8s world An opinionated abstraction layer to deploy and manage our Kubernetes deployments Enforce DevOps best practices: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Configuration Management (CM) GitOps Continuous Integration (CI) Continuous Delivery (CD) Documentation as Code A consistent toolset Observability (monitoring, logging, alerting, trending) Continuous Delivery (change management + Git features) Dynamic Web Routing Dynamic Storage Provisioning Dynamic Certificate Management Authentication and Authorization With the following main features: Supports multiple Kubernetes distributions (AWS EKS, Azure AKS, Local k3s for development and testing purposes), Supports blue/green or prod/qa/int/dev patterns, Fully automated with GitLab CI pipelines, Infrastructure as Code with Terraform, Automatic deployment of \"core apps\" (cert-manager, prometheus, alertmanager, grafana, loki, ingress controller…) in GitOps spirit with ArgoCD, Central point of documentations with Antora.

However, Kubernetes versions are supported for one year, so the cluster needs to be regularly upgraded. This is a great opportunity to adopt a continuous upgrade strategy, which will contribute to limit Technical Debt on the long run. Two strategies are possible: in-place upgrades or greenfield (aka blue/green). A greenfield approach avoids dealing with complex Kubernetes upgrades by reinstalling the cluster from scratch for every upgrade. The automation brought by the DevOps Stack makes it easy to adopt a greenfield approach, since the whole stack is managed as code. The DevOps Stack allows you to have one cluster per git branch (using one Terraform workspace per branch), so both strategies are possible. Below is a comparison of the two approaches. The In-place upgrade strategy consists in upgrading the Kubernetes cluster while it is running. No need to redeploy everything on upgrade Something could go wrong during the upgrade, requiring to reinstall and redeploy everything from scratch, To mitigate this risk, set up a lab infrastructure with the exact same upgrade paths to test the upgrade on it beforehand, Hardly ever tested disaster strategy. a \"production\" branch for production deployments a \"lab\" branch to test upgrades before upgrading the production No risk to break cluster on upgrade, Major infrastructure changes possible without risking to break something (change Ingress Controller, switch to Service Mesh, change your network allocation plan…), Disaster recovery strategy tested on every upgrade. New challenges for data persistence: RWO volumes can’t be attached to both cluster at the same time, May require to synchronize some auto-generated objects to the new cluster (Secrets containing ServiceAccounts tokens if used outside cluster, Secrets containing Certificates generated by cert-manager, PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolumeClaims generated by StorageClasses…), Requires a fully automated deployment strategy (which is a good thing). A \"blue\" branch and a \"green\" branch. Deploy a brand new cluster on the inactive branch, test everything and once happy, switch the DNS or a frontal Load Balancer to the inactive cluster that becomes the active one. When adopting a blue/green strategy, static resources —such as VPC, RDS or ElastiCache if you are on AWS— need to be declared in a separate Terraform project.","title":"Kubernetes Upgrade Strategy","component":"ROOT","version":"v1","name":"upgrade_strategy","url":"/latest/explanations/upgrade_strategy.html","titles":[{"text":"In-place Upgrade","hash":"_in_place_upgrade","id":1},{"text":"Pros","hash":"_pros","id":2},{"text":"Cons","hash":"_cons","id":3},{"text":"Example workflow","hash":"_example_workflow","id":4},{"text":"Green field Upgrade","hash":"_green_field_upgrade","id":5},{"text":"Pros","hash":"_pros_2","id":6},{"text":"Cons","hash":"_cons_2","id":7},{"text":"Example workflow","hash":"_example_workflow_2","id":8}]},"13":{"id":13,"text":"This article describes how to add your app to a DevOps Stack instance and make use of the continuous deployment features (Argo CD).

Create a new project on GitLab and push your Terraform files on it. You can use either gitlab.com or your self hosted GitLab instance. The cluster creation pipeline is triggered only on protected branches, so you have to protect every branch that will define a cluster (in Settings ⇒ Repository ⇒ Protected Branches). There are multiple ways to configure the Terraform SKS provider. You could commit the credentials in your code, with a high potential risk of secret leakage, or another simple solution is to define the required environment variables as CI/CD variables. In your project’s Setting → CI/CD → Variables, add variables for: EXOSCALE_API_KEY EXOSCALE_API_SECRET In order to use Gitlab as Continuous Delivery, you have to create a .gitlab-ci.yml file in the root level of your project. --- include: - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/camptocamp/devops-stack/v0.47.0/.gitlab-ci/pipeline.yaml The pipeline, and hence the cluster creation, will be triggered when you push to a protected branch, but you can trigger a pipeline manually if needed (in CI/CD ⇒ Pipelines ⇒ Run Pipeline). Create a new project on GitHub and push your Terraform files on it. There are multiple ways to configure the Terraform SKS provider. You could commit the credentials in your code, with a high potential risk of leakage, or another simple solution is to define the required environment variables as Actions secrets. In your project settings in Secrets Actions, create secrets for these variables: EXOSCALE_API_KEY EXOSCALE_API_SECRET Unfortunately, composite Actions have some limitations right now, so we can’t provide a single Action to declare in your workflow (as we do for GitLab pipeline). Hence, you have to create a .github/workflows/terraform.yml file with this content: --- name: 'Terraform' on: push: branches: - main pull_request: jobs: terraform: name: Terraform runs-on: ubuntu-latest env: EXOSCALE_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.EXOSCALE_API_KEY }} EXOSCALE_API_SECRET: ${{ secrets.EXOSCALE_API_SECRET }} TF_ROOT: terraform defaults: run: working-directory: ${{ env.TF_ROOT }} steps: - name: Checkout uses: actions/checkout@v2 - name: Setup Terraform uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v1 with: terraform_version: 0.14.10 - name: Terraform Format run: terraform fmt -check -diff -recursive - name: Terraform Init run: terraform init - name: Terraform Validate run: terraform validate -no-color - name: Terraform Plan if: github.event_name == 'pull_request' run: terraform plan -no-color -out plan - name: Install aws-iam-authenticator if: github.event_name == 'push' run: | mkdir -p ${{ github.workspace }}/bin curl -o ${{ github.workspace }}/bin/aws-iam-authenticator https://amazon-eks.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1.19.6/2021-01-05/bin/linux/amd64/aws-iam-authenticator chmod +x ${{ github.workspace }}/bin/aws-iam-authenticator echo \"PATH=${{ github.workspace }}/bin:$PATH\" >> $GITHUB_ENV - name: Terraform Apply if: github.event_name == 'push' run: terraform apply --auto-approve - name: Terraform Plan if: github.event_name == 'push' run: terraform plan --detailed-exitcode -no-color Retrieve the kubeconfig using the following command: exo sks kubeconfig -z > kubeconfig.yaml A_USER_NAME is the name of the user (certificate CN) to create for the new account associated with the config file.

DevOps Stack module to deploy a KinD cluster based on Docker. This cluster module is mainly used to deploy a single-node Kubernetes cluster used for testing and development as well as for onboarding new users of the DevOps Stack. Because KinD is nothing more than a Kubernetes cluster running inside a container, it is required that you have Docker up and running on your machine (the documentation to install Docker is available here here). This module can be declared by adding the following block on your Terraform configuration: module \"kind\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-kind.git?ref=\" cluster_name = local.cluster_name } You can configure the version of Kubernetes by passing the variable kubernetes_version. This variable is nothing more than the tag of the image that is to be deployed. You can see the usable versions in Docker Hub. module \"kind\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-kind.git?ref=\" cluster_name = local.cluster_name kubernetes_version = \"1.25.3\" } It is also possible to configure the ports that are mapped between the KinD container and your machine. This is needed in order to access services that you deploy inside the cluster. By default, this module already maps the ports needed for HTTP and HTTPS traffic. module \"kind\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-kind.git?ref=\" cluster_name = local.cluster_name extra_port_mappings = [\"tcp/22\", \"udp/53\"] } A test deployment of the DevOps Stack is available here. Obviously, since this module deploys the cluster, it does not depend on any other module of the DevOps Stack. The only thing you’ll probably want to configure are some locals with some common variables used on all the modules: locals { cluster_name = \"gh-v1-cluster\" cluster_issuer = \"ca-issuer\" argocd_namespace = \"argocd\" } The following requirements are needed by this module: docker (~> 2.23.1) kind (~> 0.0.16) The following providers are used by this module: docker (~> 2.23.1) kind (~> 0.0.16) No modules. The following resources are used by this module: kind_cluster.cluster (resource) docker_network.kind_network (data source) No required inputs. === Optional Inputs The following input variables are optional (have default values): Description: The base domain used for ingresses.

The module creates an Argo CD AppProject using the name given on declaration and then creates an Argo CD Application using the chart that is inside the path for the Git repository that is declared. Inside that folder, the module expects an Helm chart with a folder structure similar to the following (as is standard practice): application_folder ├── Chart.yaml ├── charts │ ├── dependency1.tar.gz │ └── dependency2.tar.gz ├── secrets.yaml ├── templates │ ├── template1.yaml │ ├── template2.yaml │ ├── template3.yaml │ └── _helpers.tpl └── values.yaml By default, the created AppProject can only create an Application within a Namespace of the same name or within a Namespace declared on the module declaration. Besides that, the AppProject has the permission to create any kind of Kubernetes resources inside the destination cluster, but you can restrict the allowed resources if you need to. This module can be declared by adding the following block on your Terraform configuration: module \"module_name\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-application.git?ref=\" name = \"application-name\" argocd_namespace = local.argocd_namespace source_repo = \"https://address.com/owner/repository.git\" source_repo_path = \"path/to/chart\" source_target_revision = \"branch\" depends_on = [module.argocd] } A more complex declaration, that defines the Namespace and also the AppProject allowed resources, would look like this: module \"module_name\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-application.git?ref=\" name = \"application-name\" argocd_namespace = local.argocd_namespace source_repo = \"https://address.com/owner/repository.git\" source_repo_path = \"path/to/chart\" source_target_revision = \"branch\" destination_namespace = \"namespace\" project_cluster_resource_whitelist = [ { group = \"*\" kind = \"Namespace\" }, ] project_namespace_resource_whitelist = [ { group = \"apps\" kind = \"Deployment\" }, { group = \"*\" kind = \"Service\" }, ] depends_on = [module.argocd] } Furthermore, you can customize the chart’s values.yaml by adding an Helm configuration as an HCL structure: module \"module_name\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-application.git?ref=\" name = \"application-name\" argocd_namespace = local.argocd_namespace source_repo = \"https://address.com/owner/repository.git\" source_repo_path = \"path/to/chart\" source_target_revision = \"branch\" helm_values = [{ # Note the curly brackets here map = { string = \"string\" bool = true } sequence = [ { key1 = \"value1\" key2 = \"value2\" }, { key1 = \"value1\" key2 = \"value2\" }, ] sequence2 = [ \"string1\", \"string2\" ] }] depends_on = [module.argocd] } When your charts are stored inside a private repository, Argo CD needs to have the credentials necessary to have at least read access to the contents of the repository. This module has 2 variables you can use for that, depending on the type of credentials you want to configure, either HTTPS or SSH. You’ll need to pass a string containing a private SSH key in the variable source_credentials_ssh_key (you can pass the value however you want, as long as it is a string) and the repository needs to be of the type git@address.com:owner/repository. Do not hardcode your SSH private key as the example below! Either create the SSH key using Terraform and pass the output directly or use SOPS to store and pass the key as a secret. module \"module_name\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-application.git?ref=\" name = \"application-name\" argocd_namespace = local.argocd_namespace source_repo = \"git@address.com:owner/repository\" source_repo_path = \"path/to/chart\" source_target_revision = \"branch\" source_credentials_ssh_key = \"-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----\\nfoo\\nbar\\n-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----\" depends_on = [module.argocd] } You’ll need to pass the username and password inside the variable source_credentials_https and the repository needs to be of the type https://address.com/owner/repository. Do not hardcode your password the example below! It is recommended to pass the value as secret, either using SOPS or another provider. Another best practice would be to use a token you created on Github.com (or another provider) that has the least amount of access needed (in these use-case, Argo CD only needs read access). module \"module_name\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-application.git?ref=\" name = \"application-name\" argocd_namespace = local.argocd_namespace source_repo = \"https://address.com/owner/repository.git\" source_repo_path = \"path/to/chart\" source_target_revision = \"branch\" source_credentials_https = { username = \"your_username\" password = \"your_token_password\" https_insecure = false } depends_on = [module.argocd] } As this is an application, it needs to be deployed after the deployment of Argo CD and consequently this module needs to have this explicit dependency.

This module can be declared by adding the following block on your Terraform configuration: module \"thanos\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-thanos.git//eks\" cluster_name = var.cluster_name argocd_namespace = module.cluster.argocd_namespace base_domain = module.cluster.base_domain cluster_issuer = var.cluster_issuer cluster_oidc_issuer_url = module.cluster.cluster_oidc_issuer_url thanos = { oidc = module.oidc.oidc } depends_on = [module.argocd_bootstrap] } A more complex complex declaration, one that changes the default values for the compactor retention times, would look like this: module \"thanos\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-thanos.git//eks\" cluster_name = var.cluster_name argocd_namespace = module.cluster.argocd_namespace base_domain = module.cluster.base_domain cluster_issuer = var.cluster_issuer cluster_oidc_issuer_url = module.cluster.cluster_oidc_issuer_url thanos = { oidc = module.oidc.oidc compactor_retention = { raw = \"60d\" five_min = \"120d\" one_hour = \"240d\" } } depends_on = [module.argocd_bootstrap] } Furthermore, you can customize the chart’s values.yaml by adding an Helm configuration as an HCL structure: module \"thanos\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-thanos.git//eks\" cluster_name = var.cluster_name argocd_namespace = module.cluster.argocd_namespace base_domain = module.cluster.base_domain cluster_issuer = var.cluster_issuer cluster_oidc_issuer_url = module.cluster.cluster_oidc_issuer_url thanos = { oidc = module.oidc.oidc } helm_values = [{ # Note the curly brackets here thanos = { map = { string = \"string\" bool = true } sequence = [ { key1 = \"value1\" key2 = \"value2\" }, { key1 = \"value1\" key2 = \"value2\" }, ] sequence2 = [ \"string1\", \"string2\" ] } }] depends_on = [module.argocd_bootstrap] } As you can see on the examples above, the variable thanos provides an interface to customize the most frequently used settings. This variable is merged with the local value thanos_defaults, which contains some sensible defaults. You can check the default values on the local.tf file. This module was developed with OIDC in mind! There is an OIDC proxy container deployed as a sidecar on each pod that has a web interface. Consequently, the thanos variable is expected to have a map oidc containing at least the Issuer URL, the Client ID, and the Client Secret. You can pass these values by pointing an output from another module (as above), or by defining them explicitly: module \"thanos\" { ... thanos = { oidc = { issuer_url = \"\" client_id = \"\" client_secret = \"\" } } ... } This module must be one of the first ones to be deployed and consequently it needs to be deployed exactly after the module argocd_bootstrap. No requirements. The following providers are used by this module: aws The following Modules are called: Source: terraform-aws-modules/iam/aws//modules/iam-assumable-role-with-oidc Version: 4.0.0 Source: ../ Version: The following resources are used by this module: aws_iam_policy.thanos_s3_policy (resource) aws_s3_bucket.thanos_metrics_store (resource) aws_iam_policy_document.thanos_s3_policy (data source) aws_region.current (data source) The following input variables are required: Description: Namespace used by Argo CD where the Application and AppProject resources should be created.
