=== GitLab CI

==== Push your code in a new project on Gitlab

Create a new project on GitLab and push your Terraform files on it.
You can use either gitlab.com or your self hosted GitLab instance.

==== Protect your branch

The cluster creation pipeline is triggered only on protected branches,
so you have to protect every branch that will define a cluster
(in Settings => Repository => Protected Branches).

==== Add CI / CD variables

There are multiple ways to configure the
{terraform-provider-link}[Terraform {terraform-provider} provider].
You could commit the credentials in your code,
with a high potential risk of secret leakage,
or another simple solution is to define the required environment variables as CI/CD variables.

In your project's Setting → CI/CD → Variables, add variables for:


include::partial$variables-{ci-variables}.adoc[]



==== Create `.gitlab-ci.yml`

In order to use Gitlab as Continuous Delivery,
you have to create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in the root level of your project.

```yaml
---
include:
  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/camptocamp/devops-stack/v0.26.0/.gitlab-ci/pipeline.yaml
```

==== Trigger pipeline

The pipeline, and hence the cluster creation,
will be triggered when you push to a protected branch,
but you can trigger a pipeline manually if needed (in CI/CD ⇒ Pipelines ⇒ Run Pipeline).
