=== Finding the URLs of the services

The Access URLs are found as output of terraform, look in your console for something like:

[source,shell]

Outputs:

admin_password = "dEzq88Zx0SY2FSFQ"
alertmanager_url = "https://alertmanager.apps.10-17-3-127.nip.io"
app_of_apps_values = <sensitive>
argocd_auth_token = <sensitive>
argocd_url = "https://argocd.apps.10-17-3-127.nip.io"
base_domain = "10-17-3-127.nip.io"
grafana_url = "https://grafana.apps.10-17-3-127.nip.io"

prometheus_url = "https://prometheus.apps.10-17-3-127.nip.io"
repo_url = "https://github.com/.git"

=== Finding the kubeconfig

The kubeconfig file is written on disk by terraform the path is `terraform/kubeconfig.yaml` in the flavor directory.

Exporting the `KUBECONFIG` variable to point to that file will allow you to use the `kubectl` and other kubernetes tools to manipulate your cluster.
