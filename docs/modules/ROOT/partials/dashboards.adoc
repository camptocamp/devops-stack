=== Identity Management Dashboard (Keycloak)
Whether you use AKS, EKS, or your local workstation using k3s, the DevOps Stack provisions the cluster with an Identity and Access Manager.
For the case of a local k3s cluster, the DevOps Stack spawns a Keyclaok instance (for more plase see xref:ROOT:references/athentication.adoc[authentication references]).
