=== Testing a terraform change

By simply running the Makefile again all changes to the terraform code will be applied.

=== Making a change to an Application deployed by ArgoCD

Due to how ArgoCD works, you need to commit and push your change to a fork of the project for it to be visible.
ArgoCD should be in auto-sync by default, if it is not, you can visit the administration page of ArgoCD which url was given in the terraform ouput and manually sync.
