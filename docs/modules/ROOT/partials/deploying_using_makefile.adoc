=== Finding the flavor

In the `tests` folder at the root of the repository, you can find all flavors that are ready to use. The name of the folders describe the flavor of the DevOps stack that will be installed. For example:

[source,shell]
--------------
$ ls tests/
k3s-docker
k3s-libvirt
--------------

You can see that, here, both flavors are `k3s` and one installs it using `docker` while the other uses `libvirt`.

=== Deploying using Makefile

The folder of the flavor you are trying to test contains a terraform repository. Typing `terraform init && terraform apply` in that folder is sufficient to deploy the DevOps stack.

=== Cleaning up

`terraform destroy` will delete everything that was deployed for the test.
