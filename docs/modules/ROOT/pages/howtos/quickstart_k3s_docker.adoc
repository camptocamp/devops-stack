= K3s on Docker Quickstart

== Prerequisites

- Access to a functional Docker Engine,
- CGroupv2 disabled (K3s does not support it for now),
- Knowledge of https://terraform.io[Terraform] basics

== Create your Terraform root module

Camptocamp's DevOps stack is a Terraform composition module
that has to be instantiated from the Terraform root module.

Here is a minimal working example:


```hcl
# terraform/main.tf

module "cluster" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/camptocamp/camptocamp-devops-stack.git//modules/k3s/docker?ref=master"

  cluster_name = "my-cluster"
}
```
