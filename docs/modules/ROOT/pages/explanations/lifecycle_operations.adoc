= Lifecycle Operations

It is not easy to describe the different phases of an IT project,
especially when you also want to talk about operational aspects.
One way to do this, which seems to be used more and more,
is to talk about "days".

== What "days" are all about

To make it very simple, here are some explanations:

* **Day 0** is related to software development,
  questions about requirements, architecture and design.
* **Day 1** is more about deploying software developed
  in the **Day 0** and starting to build and configure
  the hosting infrastructure.
* **Day 2** is the time to go live and hope that the efforts
  made in **Day 1** are adequate.
  This is a crucial moment, when it is imperative to have metrics,
  monitoring, tools and best practices to do efficient troubleshooting.

For now, the DevOps Stack is very focused on the points relating to days 1 and 2.
In particular, the aspects related to the provisioning of a Kubernetes platform
as well as the mandatory services related to its operational management.
We must also take into account that using the Cloud and Cloud Native development
practices make it much easier to handle changes related to software life cycle.
The boundaries and responsibilities between these different phases
have become more blurred, less strict.


== Developers need love

In the near future, we really want to invest significantly in aspects related
to day 0 by improving the DevOps Stack in that direction,
especially the software factory and development best practices
related to Kubernetes integration.
This is closely linked to the generalization
of the https://12factor.net/[Twelve-Factor App]
methodology, as well as breaking silos and embracing DevOps principles.
These good practices should be applied as early as possible in projects.
It is absolutely necessary.

== Sysadmins want control

The DevOps Stack provisions our k8s cluster with a set of administration and monitoring tools out-of-the-box.
Here below some of the services' dashboards.
