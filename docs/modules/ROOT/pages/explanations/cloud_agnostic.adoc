= Cloud Agnostic

Nobody likes to be locked-in. That's why the DevOps Stack provides a cloud abstraction so you can deploy it on top of multiple Cloud Platforms, in an agnostic way.

Currently, the DevOps Stack supports the following Cloud Platforms, besides a local test deployment with KinD:

- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Azure
- Exoscale
- Scaleway

Good "agnostic" automation practices offer many benefits.
