= Documentation

== Documentation as code

https://antora.org/[Antora] allows us to manage our documentation *as code*, which allow us to build our website the same way as we would build a software, store the code in a version control system and build/publish our documentation website using the same CI/CD principles as used for our softwares or our infrastructures.

== Asciidoc

https://asciidoc.org/[Asciidoc] is a lightweight markup language, similar to https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/[Markdown] but offers more possibilites and https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-vs-markdown/#graduating-to-asciidoc[more flexibility]. 
It is higly configurable and allows to write documentation, articles, web pages, etc.

== Integration with Github

The website for our documentation can be automatically built and published on https://pages.github.com/[Github Pages] using https://github.com/features/actions[Github Actions].

== Highly customizable appearance

The appearance of the website is externalized in an  https://github.com/camptocamp/antora-ui/[independant project] and packaged as UI bundle. It can be highly adapted to ones needs and be can reused over multiple documentation projects.

== Structure

We follow the https://documentation.divio.com/structure/[Divio documentation structure] to organize the documentation of this project, which is written in https://asciidoc.org/[Asciidoc] and built using https://antora.org/[Antora]

In short, we break up the global documentation of the project in 4 parts, each of which being useful at a different time in the understanding or usage of the project:

- *tutorials* focusing on the learning
- *how-to guides* focusing on solving specific problems
- *reference guides* focusing on giving information
- *explanation* focusing on offering a better understanding

There are overlaps between those elements, but respecting this separation prevents us from building a confused (and confusing) documentation.

== Appearance

The UI for documentation sites created using https://antora.org/[Antora] is externalized in a separated project named https://github.com/camptocamp/antora-ui/[antora-ui], forked from https://gitlab.com/antora/antora-ui-default[antora-ui-default]. This project produces an UI bundle containing all UI assets (CSS, Javascript, images, etc) using a gulp build script.

This UI bundle is linked to in the `antora-playbook.yml` of the documentation project and is dynamically pulled and loaded to render the resulting website during the buid phase.
