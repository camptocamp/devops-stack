== Documentation

=== Structure

include::ROOT:partial$documentation_structure.adoc[]

There are overlaps between those elements, but respecting this separation prevents us from building a confused (and confusing) documentation.

=== Appearance

The UI for documentation sites created using https://antora.org/[Antora] is externalized in a separated project named https://github.com/camptocamp/antora-ui/[antora-ui], forked from https://gitlab.com/antora/antora-ui-default[antora-ui-default]. This project produces an UI bundle containing all UI assets (CSS, Javascript, images, etc) using a gulp build script.

This UI bundle is linked to in the `antora-playbook.yml` of the documentation project and is dynamically pulled and loaded to render the resulting website during the buid phase.
