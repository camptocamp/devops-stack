== Documentation

=== Structure

We follow the https://documentation.divio.com/structure/[Divio documentation structure] to organize the documentation of this project, which is written in https://asciidoc.org/[Asciidoc] and built using https://antora.org/[Antora]

In short, we break up the documentation in 4 parts, each of which being useful at a different time in the understanding or usage of the project:

- *tutorials* focusing on the learning
- *how-to guides* focusing on solving specific problems
- *reference guides* focusing on giving information
- *explanation* focusing on offering a better understanding

There are overlaps between those 4 elements, but respecting this separation prevents us from building a confused (and confusing) documentation.

=== Appearance

The UI for documentation sites created using https://antora.org/[Antora] is externalized in a separated project named https://github.com/camptocamp/antora-ui/[antora-ui], forked from https://gitlab.com/antora/antora-ui-default[antora-ui-default]. This project produces an UI bundle containing all UI assets (CSS, Javascript, images, etc) using a gulp build script.

This UI bundle is linked to in the `antora-playbook.yml` of the documentation project and is dynamically pulled and loaded to render the resulting website during the buid phase.
