When first creating a module for the DevOps Stack, there are a few steps to follow:

1. Create a new repository in the https://github.com/camptocamp/[Camptocamp GitHub organization], using the {url-template-repo}[repository template].

2. Go to the settings of the repository and to the _General_ tab:

  a. On the _Features_ section, disable the _Wikis_, _Sponsorships_ and _Discussions_, then make sure the _Issues_ and _Projects_ are enabled.
  
  b. On the _Pull Requests_ section, disable the _Allow merge commits_ option and enable the _Automatically delete head branches_ option.

3. Then go to the _Collaborators and teams_ tab, add the `infrastructure-department` team as _Maintainers_ and the https://github.com/orgs/camptocamp/teams/is-devops-stack/[`@camptocamp/is-devops-stack` team] team as _Administrators_.

4. Next go to the _Branches_ tab, and create a new branch protection rule for the `main` branch, with the following settings.

5. Finally, still on the settings of the repository, under _Secrets and variables_, go to _Actions_ and add the secret `PROJECT_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`, which is needed to automatically add Issues and PRs to our project board. Check with the team where you can find this secret.

6. Go the the _Projects_ tab of the repository and add the https://github.com/orgs/camptocamp/projects/3/[DevOps Stack project] (https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-your-project/adding-your-project-to-a-repository[documentation]).

7. Request that an administrator of our GitHub organization adds the newly created repository to the app that automatically adds Issues and PRs to our project board (check the xref:ROOT:contributing/project_board.adoc[Project Board] page for more information).

8. Afterwards, you need to add the Slack app to the repository in order to activate notifications on the https://camptocamp.slack.com/archives/C01DPEV82F6[#is-devops-stack] channel. To do so, go to the channel and do the following:
  
  a. Type `/github subscribe camptocamp/<MODULE_NAME>`.

  b. Since it a new repository, Slack is not yet added as an authorized application, as you'll see by the information on the channel. So you simply need to click _Install GitHub App_.

  c. On the window that appears, select the Camptocamp organization then select the repository you to add the Slack app to.

  d. Then, you can go back to the channel and type `/github subscribe camptocamp/<MODULE_NAME>` again. This time, you should see a confirmation message.

  e. Finally, unsubscribe to all the other types of notifications, except for _Releases_ with the command: `/github unsubscribe camptocamp/<MODULE_NAME> issues pulls commits deployments`.

9. All that is left to do is adding the repository to our team reminder. For that, you can go to the https://github.com/orgs/camptocamp/teams/is-devops-stack/[`@camptocamp/is-devops-stack` team], and add the repository to our scheduled reminder on Slack about pending Pull Requests.
