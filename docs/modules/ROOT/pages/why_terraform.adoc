= Why Terraform?

As we already use Terraform to deploy our other Kubernetes clusters,
such as EKS, AKS, OpenShift on different cloud, it looks natural to also
use Terraform to deploy a K3s cluster locally.

This allows us to use the same `scripts/provision.sh` script, whatever
the platform on which we deploy our clusters.

Also, we can use
https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/workspaces.html[Terraform
workspaces] to create one cluster per git branch, which is quite
convenient for testing.
