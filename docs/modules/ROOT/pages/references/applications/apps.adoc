====

This chart is a composition of subcharts. Each of the subcharts installs
one app of the `argocd/app-of-apps` (if parameterized as `enabled`).

The following is a non-comprehensive list of the apps included:

* argocd
* cert-manager
* loki-stack
* kube-prometheus-stack
* minio
* keycloak

Some of the apps are automatically disabled based on the type of cloud
platform used. To enable/disable apps please see
