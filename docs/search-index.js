DevOps Stack provides a standardized deployment Kubernetes Platform, bringing together automated Provisioning as Code, Continuous Application Deployment, and readily-made configurations for the best Cloud Native tools in the industry. The easiest way to get started with the DevOps Stack is to follow the tutorial on the Deployment on KinD page. This tutorial you will leave you with a fully operational KinD playground on your local machine. This project is mainly developed and sponsored by Camptocamp. It is an internal work created to standardize and maintain our Kubernetes deployments for our clients. However, the source code is open and distributed under the Apache 2 license. The DevOps Stack is composed of several Terraform modules used to deploy a Kubernetes cluster along with a stack of components that will allow you to deploy applications as well as monitor and troubleshoot your cluster. The choice of the cluster module is dependant on the provider on which you wish to deploy your cluster. The DevOps Stack currently supports Amazon EKS, Azure AKS and a local testing deployment using KinD. The modules that deploy the remaining components of the stack are as generic as possible, but some have provider-specific variants that deploy different resources depending on the platform. As you’ll see in the examples, after the cluster is deployed, a temporary Argo CD is installed to then deploy the rest of the components. After all the components have been deployed, this Argo CD instance is then replaced by a permanent one that will manage the updates of all the components and can be used to deploy your applications (we also created modules to create and configure Argo CD Applications and ApplicationSets). These documentation pages are the main source of information for the DevOps Stack. They are written in AsciiDoc and built using Antora. The main documentation contains information pertaining to the DevOps Stack as a whole while the module pages contain more specific and technical details about each individual module. We recommend you take a look into the general documentation first in order to have an overview of a DevOps Stack deployment and then navigate the sidebar to consult each module documentation. This documentation as well as some examples are stored on the main repository on GitHub. Since this is an internal project of Camptocamp, some of the documentation pages may be more geared towards our employees and teams. On the contributing section of the sidebar you’ll find some guidelines on how to contribute to the DevOps Stack. You have some general guidelines on how to contribute to the project along with explanations on how a module is structured, how to write documentation and how the release process works. We welcome any kind of contribution, whether it’s a bug report, a feature request, a documentation improvement or even a code contribution. You are also welcome to create your own cluster provisioning modules and request any help from us, but we can’t guarantee any maintenance or long-term support for them.","title":"DevOps Stack","component":"ROOT","version":"v1.11.0","name":"index","url":"/latest/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Project Sponsor","hash":"_project_sponsor","id":1},{"text":"Quick Explanation","hash":"_quick_explanation","id":2},{"text":"Documentation","hash":"_documentation","id":3},{"text":"Contributing","hash":"_contributing","id":4}]},"2":{"id":2,"text":"These documentation pages are written in AsciiDoc format and this website you are is generated using Antora. Antora builds this documentation website from the configurations in an Antora Playbook, which is a YAML file that describes the documentation sources and the output of the build. Our playbook is stored on the root of the main repository of the DevOps Stack project, in the antora-playbook.yml file. It is this file that defines the content sources (in our case each module of the DevOps Stack project) as well as the tags to take into account when building the documentation. In this file you’ll see a source for the main documentation (that is, the more generic pages stored in the main repository) and sources for each module on a list under content.sources. Each source is defined by a url to its repo and a start_path that tells Antora where the respective documentation is stored. Each documentation source is expected to have a precise file structure, as documented in extensive detail in the Antora documentation. In short, the documentation source is expected to have a antora.yml file at its root, a modules folder that contains the documentation modules and a nav.adoc. The nav.adoc file is used to generate the navigation menu on the left of the documentation website and the documentation pages are used to generate the content of the website. You’ll see this folder structure throughout our modules inside the docs folder. More information about the antora.yml and the nav.adoc file can be found here and here, respectively. In short, our documentation sources are expected to have at least the following structure: docs ├── antora.yml └── modules └── ROOT ├── nav.adoc └── pages └── ... The antora.yml for each module is quite simple: --- name: \"\" # The name of the module that will appear in the URL of the generated documentation, use something short. title: \"\" # The title of the module that will appear in the navigation menu of the generated documentation. version: true # Tells Antora to use the version tag of the module as the version of the documentation. start_page: README.adoc # Tells Antora which page to use as the start page of this module's documentation. nav: - \"modules/ROOT/nav.adoc\" # Tells Antora which navigation file to use for this module's documentation. Each module’s documentation page is versioned using its repository tags, which are automatically created by the Release Please CI. On each source of our Antora playbook, we can define which version tags we include or exclude using the syntax explained here. In our case, note that we chose to use the tags instead of the branches for versioning the document pages. This is because we release each new version on a single branch but through multiple tags. More explanations about the different versioning methods are available here. Our documentation is built using a GitHub Action on the main repository, available here. In the workflow, you will note that our documentation is generated using a customized Docker image of Antora. This is because we require two extensions on top of Antora, as explained in the README.adoc. The release process of this image is also explained on said README.adoc. The UI of the documentation pages comes from a fork of the default Antora UI, available here. This fork is used to add a custom syntax highlighter for Terraform code blocks. In order to use this UI, we simply create a *.zip bundle with a GitHub Actions workflow that is then pointed to by our antora-playbook.yml file. The README.adoc of the customized Docker image contains a command that you can use to build the documentation pages locally to preview you changes. After generating the documentation, it is then published to the gh-pages branch of the main repository. This branch is then used by GitHub Pages to serve the documentation website. The documentation in each module is quite particular in the sense that we have not put the documentation pages on the docs folder. Instead we have symbolic links to the README.adoc on the root of the repository and to the README.adoc inside each variant. Consequently, a typical module as a structure like this: devops-stack-module-template └── docs ├── antora.yml └── modules └── ROOT ├── nav.adoc └── pages ├── aks │ └── README.adoc -> ../../../../../aks/README.adoc ├── eks │ └── README.adoc -> ../../../../../eks/README.adoc ├── kind │ └── README.adoc -> ../../../../../kind/README.adoc └── README.adoc -> ../../../../README.adoc As you can see, besides the root README.adoc, each variant should have its own file. This is because of the way the automatic documentation is generated (Terraform Docs needs to put the generated documentation on separate files) and since each variant has its own specificities. A simple module without variants has a simpler structure: devops-stack-module-template └── docs ├── antora.yml └── modules └── ROOT ├── nav.adoc └── pages └── README.adoc -> ../../../../README.adoc The module template contains a good example of what the README.adoc should include in its content. A good README.adoc should contain a small description of what the module does and, if it installs a chart, list the chart version along with a link to the official chart and documentation. Next, show some examples of the usage of the module, from the simplest to the most complex. Finally, the end of the module will contain the automatic documentation. A module that has variants will be a bit different. The main README.adoc should contain an introduction and chart version, but it is each variant’s README.adoc that should have usage examples, as these are different from variant to variant. Check the existing module’s documentation pages for examples (the Thanos module is a good example of a module with variants and the Keycloak module is an example without). You’ll notice that the last sections of the README.adoc that are automatically generated by Terraform Docs. Everything that is between the comments BEGIN_TF_DOCS / END_TF_DOCS and BEGIN_TF_TABLES / END_TF_TABLES is generated automatically by a GitHub workflow, that is available in the main repository.","title":"Documentation","component":"ROOT","version":"v1.11.0","name":"documentation","url":"/latest/contributing/documentation.html","titles":[{"text":"How does Antora work?","hash":"_how_does_antora_work","id":1},{"text":"Content sources","hash":"_content_sources","id":2},{"text":"File structure","hash":"_file_structure","id":3},{"text":"Versioning","hash":"_versioning","id":4},{"text":"Building the documentation","hash":"_building_the_documentation","id":5},{"text":"Module documentation","hash":"_module_documentation","id":6},{"text":"Content","hash":"_content","id":7},{"text":"Terraform Docs documentation","hash":"_terraform_docs_documentation","id":8}]},"3":{"id":3,"text":"This document describes the general guidelines for contributing to the DevOps Stack. The DevOps Stack is a collection of modules, each of them having its own release cycle, in order to ease the development and maintenance of each module. A private GitHub project owned by the @camptocamp/is-devops-stack team is available here. It is a useful way to follow the progress of the PRs and Issues of all the repositories. For more information on how it is implemented, check the Project Board page. When a new feature or fix is required, the typical workflow is the following: You should create a new branch from the main branch of the module you want to work on; Work and test on your branch; When you think you feature/fix is ready, create a Pull Request to merge your branch into the main branch. The following subsections describe some of the best practices to follow when working on the DevOps Stack. Keep the main branch clean, and only merge Pull Requests into it. Create a new branch for each Pull Request. The name of the branch should be the Jira ticket number, followed by a short description of the work done in the branch, for example ISDEVOPS-185-v1-docs. This will allow the Jira ticket to be automatically linked to the branch and the Pull Request. When committing to your branch, you should follow the Conventional Commits specification. This will also allow the automated changelog generation to work properly. We use the following commit types: feat - a new feature fix - a bug fix docs - documentation only changes style - changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc) refactor - a code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature ci - changes to the CI configuration files and scripts chore - other changes that don’t really modify the code (could be a merge commit, for example, chore: rebase 'main' into 'ISDEVOPS-184-v1-docs' before merging PR) If your commit adds a breaking change, you should add a ! after the commit type, for example feat!: add a breaking change. Adding a breaking change will automatically trigger a major version bump when the module is released. The commit scope is optional but recommended: At least, for the modules that have variants, it is recommended to include the variant on the scope (eks, aks or kind). You could simply use the variant or even use the variant as a prefix (for example, docs(eks-variables): add descriptions). If modifying something on the chart, you should add chart as the scope. Otherwise, recommended scopes could just be the type of code changed, for example, variables, outputs, main, etc. The conventional commits specification also allows you to add a body and a footer to the commit message. You could use the body to add more details and context to the commit, but keep it short. The footer could be used to add a reference to a Jira ticket, for example. You can create Pull Requests from your branch any time during the development, but if it isn’t ready to be merged, you should mark it as a Draft Pull Request. This will prevent it from being merged by mistake while still allowing you to get feedback from other developers as well as the automated checks and documentation generation done by GitHub Actions. For a PR to be merged, you need to have at least a review from another developer and all the automated checks must pass. Comments on the PR are welcome and allow us to keep track of the discussions that happen on the PR. We prefer using the Rebase and Merge option when merging a PR. This allows the automatic release process to add multiple entries on the changelog, one for each commit on the PR. This is particularly useful when the PR contains multiple changes, for example, when adding a new feature and fixing a bug at the same time. The downside of this approach is that the commit history needs to be looked after. For example, having multiple commits that say docs: fix typo is not appropriate. In this case, you should manually squash the commits into a single commit with a proper commit message. The same goes for multiple commits that where iteratively used to fix a bug or develop a feature. In this case, you should squash the commits into a single commit, one for each fix or feature. Take care to properly title and describe your Pull Request. The title should be descriptive enough and follow the conventional commits specification. As for the description, follow the template that is provided. If you do a Squash and Merge on a Pull Request, the commit message will be the title of the Pull Request. So, make sure the title is descriptive enough and follows the conventional commits specification, otherwise we will have to manually fix the commit message in the main branch, which is inconvenient, to say the least. If you find some issue on the DevOps Stack, you could create an issue on the repository in which you find the issue. An issue could be a bug or a feature request/proposition. If it is a bug, take care to properly describe the issue and provide as much context as possible. If it is a feature request/proposition, describe why the feature is needed and what problem it will solve for you. The issues are more useful for external users of the DevOps Stack, if possible we can discuss the issue on our weekly meeting and then decide if it is something that we want to implement or not. In that case, we can then create a Jira ticket, to keep track of the work that needs to be done.","title":"General Contributing Guidelines","component":"ROOT","version":"v1.11.0","name":"general_guidelines","url":"/latest/contributing/general_guidelines.html","titles":[{"text":"Development workflow","hash":"_development_workflow","id":1},{"text":"Branches","hash":"_branches","id":2},{"text":"Commit messages","hash":"_commit_messages","id":3},{"text":"Pull Requests","hash":"_pull_requests","id":4},{"text":"Issues","hash":"_issues","id":5}]},"4":{"id":4,"text":"When first creating a module for the DevOps Stack, there are a few steps to follow: Create a new repository in the Camptocamp GitHub organization, using the repository template. Go to the settings of the repository and to the General tab: On the Features section, disable the Wikis, Sponsorships and Discussions, then make sure the Issues and Projects are enabled. On the Pull Requests section, disable the Allow merge commits option and enable the Automatically delete head branches option. Then go to the Collaborators and teams tab, add the infrastructure-department team as Maintainers and the @camptocamp/is-devops-stack team team as Administrators. Next go to the Branches tab, and create a new branch protection rule for the main branch, with the following settings. Finally, still on the settings of the repository, under Secrets and variables, go to Actions and add the secret PROJECT_APP_PRIVATE_KEY, which is needed to automatically add Issues and PRs to our project board. Check with the team where you can find this secret. Go the the Projects tab of the repository and add the DevOps Stack project (documentation). Request that an administrator of our GitHub organization adds the newly created repository to the app that automatically adds Issues and PRs to our project board (check the Project Board page for more information). Afterwards, you need to add the Slack app to the repository in order to activate notifications on the #is-devops-stack channel. To do so, go to the channel and do the following: Type /github subscribe camptocamp/. Since it a new repository, Slack is not yet added as an authorized application, as you’ll see by the information on the channel. So you simply need to click Install GitHub App. On the window that appears, select the Camptocamp organization then select the repository you to add the Slack app to. Then, you can go back to the channel and type /github subscribe camptocamp/ again. This time, you should see a confirmation message. Finally, unsubscribe to all the other types of notifications, except for Releases with the command: /github unsubscribe camptocamp/ issues pulls commits deployments. All that is left to do is adding the repository to our team reminder. For that, you can go to the @camptocamp/is-devops-stack team, and add the repository to our scheduled reminder on Slack about pending Pull Requests.","title":"Module Creation Checklist","component":"ROOT","version":"v1.11.0","name":"module_creation_checklist","url":"/latest/contributing/module_creation_checklist.html","titles":[]},"5":{"id":5,"text":"The DevOps Stack is separated into multiple Terraform modules, each of them containing a set of related resources. In order to improve the readability and maintenance of the code, this page contains some guidelines and explanations behind the creation and development of DevOps Stack modules. There is also a repository template on GitHub that can be used as a starting point for new modules and you can refer to it while reading this page. These kinds of modules are typically the ones that provision clusters and related resources. Good examples of this are the Amazon EKS module and KinD module. A basic DevOps Stack module will contain the following files and folders: devops-stack-module-template ├── .github │ └── workflows │ ├── linters.yaml │ ├── release-please.yaml │ └── terraform-docs.yaml ├── CHANGELOG.md ├── CODEOWNERS ├── docs │ └── ... ├── LICENSE ├── locals.tf ├── main.tf ├── outputs.tf ├── README.adoc ├── terraform.tf ├── variables.tf └── version.txt Quick overview of each file/folder: .github - Contains the GitHub Actions workflows that are used to lint the code, generate the documentation and release the module. They are stored on the main repository and each module calls the same workflows. CHANGELOG.md - Contains the changelog of the module. It is automatically updated by the Release Please GitHub Action and you do not need to create this file manually. CODEOWNERS - Contains the list of GitHub users that will be automatically assigned as reviewers for pull requests on the module. In our case it is the @camptocamp/is-devops-stack team. docs - This is a folder that contains a precise substructure needed for the rendering of these documentation pages by Antora. The actual documentation is contained on the README.adoc files. You will find these and some other explanations about the docs on the Documentation page. LICENSE - The license of the module. In our case it is the Apache 2.0 license. README.adoc - The documentation of the module. It is written in AsciiDoc and contains the example usage along with some explanations as well as the automatic documentation generated by Terraform Docs. locals.tf - Contains the definition of the local variables used in the module. main.tf - Contains the definition of the resources that are created by the module. This can be any type of Terraform resource, depending on the use case. outputs.tf - Contains the definition of the output variables of the module. terraform.tf - Contains the versions of the required providers. The terraform.tf file should only contain the minimum required version of the required providers. This is to avoid incompatibilities between modules and it is the recommended best practices by Terraform. variables.tf - Contains the definition of the input variables of the module. version.txt - Contains the version of the module. You should only create it if you are creating a new module, after that it is automatically updated by the Release Please GitHub Action. Take care to properly describe each entry on the variables.tf and outputs.tf files. These descriptions are taken into account by Terraform Docs for the automatic documentation of the module. These are the more typical modules of the DevOps Stack and are used to deploy the remaining components of the stack. Good examples of this are the Argo CD module and cert-manager module. The Argo CD module is a special case, as it is used to deploy the other modules. A bootstrap Argo CD is deployed using resources of the type helm_release. This Argo CD is then responsible to deploy the remaining modules, which use resources of the type argocd_project and argocd_application. A typical file/folder structure for a module with embedded Helm charts is the following: devops-stack-module-template ├── .github │ └── ... ├── CHANGELOG.md ├── charts │ └── CHART_NAME │ ├── Chart.lock │ ├── charts │ │ └── CHART_NAME.tar.gz │ ├── Chart.yaml │ ├── templates │ │ └── RESOURCE.yaml │ └── values.yaml ├── CODEOWNERS ├── docs │ └── ... ├── LICENSE ├── locals.tf ├── main.tf ├── outputs.tf ├── README.adoc ├── terraform.tf ├── variables.tf └── version.txt Comparatively to a more basic module, note the following changes (all the other files are the same and are described above): charts - Contains the Helm chart(s) deployed by the module, if any. The chart itself refers to the chart that we really want to deploy as a dependency, which should be locate in the charts/CHART_NAME/charts folder. The chart package is simply downloaded manually using a helm dependency update and uploaded to the repository along with the rest of the code. locals.tf - Contains the definition of the local variables used in the module. It is here that we define the helm_values local that contains the default values for the Helm chart, as needed by the module. These should be written in HCL and not in YAML. main.tf - Contains the definition of the resources that are created by the module. It is here that we define the argocd_project and argocd_application resources that deploy the Helm chart. Some modules have multiple variants. While the core module is the same, the variants deploy different resources or customize the Helm values in order to cater to a specific use case or a different platform. A good example is the Thanos module, which has variants for EKS, AKS and KinD. These kinds of modules should be called from within their variant. The variant then recursively calls the root module ir order to apply its core resources. A typical file/folder structure for a module with variants is the following: devops-stack-module-template ├── aks │ ├── extra-variables.tf │ ├── extra-terraform.tf │ ├── locals.tf │ ├── main.tf │ ├── outputs.tf │ ├── README.adoc │ ├── variables.tf -> ../variables.tf │ └── terraform.tf -> ../terraform.tf ├── CHANGELOG.md ├── charts │ └── ... ├── CODEOWNERS ├── docs │ └── ... ├── eks │ ├── extra-variables.tf │ ├── extra-terraform.tf │ ├── locals.tf │ ├── main.tf │ ├── outputs.tf │ ├── README.adoc │ ├── variables.tf -> ../variables.tf │ └── terraform.tf -> ../terraform.tf ├── .github │ └── ... ├── kind │ ├── extra-variables.tf │ ├── extra-terraform.tf │ ├── locals.tf │ ├── main.tf │ ├── outputs.tf │ ├── README.adoc │ ├── variables.tf -> ../variables.tf │ └── terraform.tf -> ../terraform.tf ├── LICENSE ├── locals.tf ├── main.tf ├── outputs.tf ├── README.adoc ├── variables.tf ├── terraform.tf └── version.txt Note how the variables.tf and terraform.tf files are symbolic links to the root module. This is to avoid having to maintain the same variables and providers in multiple places. In case there are specific variables and/or providers you need to set, you can simply create new files like extra-variables.tf and extra-terraform.tf and add them to the variant. Comparatively to a more basic module, note the following files inside the variants (all the other files are the same and are described above): extra-variables.tf - Contains the definition of the extra input variables of the variant. These are the variables that are specific to the variant and are not present in the root module. extra-terraform.tf - Contains the versions of the required providers of the variant. These are the providers that are specific to the variant and are not present in the root module. locals.tf - Contains the definition of the local variables used in the variant. It is here that we define the helm_values local that contains only the values specific to the variant. These should be written in HCL and not in YAML. They will be merged with the ones coming from the helm_values variable and then passed on to the root module. Afterwards, they will be merged once again, translated to YAML and then passed to the argocd_application resource. main.tf - Usually, this file only contains the call to the root module and passes along all the variables received as well as the modified entries. In specific cases it could also contain other resources specific to the variant. Take a look at this example from the Loki module: module \"loki-stack\" { source = \"../\" cluster_name = var.cluster_name base_domain = var.base_domain argocd_namespace = var.argocd_namespace target_revision = var.target_revision namespace = var.namespace app_autosync = var.app_autosync dependency_ids = var.dependency_ids distributed_mode = var.distributed_mode ingress = var.ingress enable_filebeat = var.enable_filebeat sensitive_values = merge({}, var.sensitive_values) helm_values = concat(local.helm_values, var.helm_values) } outputs.tf - Contains the definition of the output variables of the variant. At the very least, it should contain the the same outputs present in the root module, in order to propagate them out. In addition, it can contain other outputs specific to the variant. See this example from the Loki module (note the id output, which only propagates the id output of the root module): output \"id\" { description = \"...\" value = module.loki-stack.id } output \"loki_credentials\" { description = \"...\" value = module.loki-stack.loki_credentials sensitive = true } README.adoc - Contains the documentation for the variant. More explanations on the Documentation page. variables.tf and terraform.tf - These files are symbolic links to the root module. The specific documentation for each modules is located in its README.adoc file. If a module contains a variant (e.g. eks or aks), the documentation should be split into multiple files, one per variant. See the Documentation page for more information. Each module is released and versioned separately. We use Semantic Versioning for versioning the modules. The release process is described in more detail in the Release page.","title":"DevOps Stack Modules","component":"ROOT","version":"v1.11.0","name":"modules","url":"/latest/contributing/modules.html","titles":[{"text":"Basic modules","hash":"_basic_modules","id":1},{"text":"Modules with embedded Helm charts","hash":"_modules_with_embedded_helm_charts","id":2},{"text":"Modules With Variants","hash":"_modules_with_variants","id":3},{"text":"Documentation","hash":"_documentation","id":4},{"text":"Release","hash":"_release","id":5}]},"6":{"id":6,"text":"In order to ease up the burden of the project maintainers, there is an internal Project Board on GitHub used to track the progress of the PRs and issues. The board is available only to the @camptocamp/is-devops-stack team and is available here. All the repositories of the DevOps Stack are also connected to this project upon creation. The way this is accomplished is somewhat convoluted, hence the reason for this documentation page. The project itself has been manually created on the @camptocamp organization, using the GitHub web interface (documentation). The project is private (documentation) and only accessible to the @camptocamp/is-devops-stack team (documentation). All the boards and tables have also been created manually. In the settings of the project, there are automation workflows (documentation) that move the Issues and PRs around depending on their status (open, closed, merged, etc.). Since there are some limits on how many repositories we can add to a project using the default workflows, we were forced to automate this process using a GitHub workflow, as suggested on the official documentation. Although the official documentation explicitly calls the API with gh commands, we opted to use an official GitHub Action (actions/add-to-project) to accomplish this. Moreover, in order to allow the workflows to modify the project we needed to create a GitHub app that the sole purpose is providing the necessary permissions to the workflows. The app is called DevOps Stack Project and is available here. This app was created on our organization by an administrator and is configured with a limited scope of permissions: it can only access the projects of the organization where it is installed as well as the PRs and Issues of repositories on which it is installed (official documentation on how to create a GitHub app). After the app creation, an administrator was needed to install it on the organization and all the repositories of the DevOps Stack. This was done by going to the app page and clicking on the Install button then configuring the proper settings after installation (all this is done on the organization settings, check the official documentation). The reason to not install the app on all the repositories by default was to further limit the scope of the app, although this adds the burden of installing it on each repository manually every time a new repository of the DevOps Stack is created.

The release-type setting is set to simple which means it only updates the CHANGELOG.md file and bumps the version in the version.txt file. The extra-files setting is used to specify additional files that need to be updated when bumping the version. In our case, we also need to update the variables.tf file. This is because we need to statically define the variable target_revision, which is used to pin the module version in argocd_application resources. The caller workflow on every module simply points to this workflow and is set to run on every push to the main branch. This is the workflow definition: --- name: \"release-please\" on: push: branches: - \"main\" jobs: release: uses: camptocamp/devops-stack/.github/workflows/modules-release-please.yaml@main Our module template already contains this workflow definition, but with a caveat. To avoid creating releases on the template itself, it was deactivated and you need to re-activate it when creating a new module. The comments on the file are self-explanatory. The commit messages are used to determine the type of release that needs to be created. Only the feat and fix commit types will trigger the release CI. The feat commit type will trigger a minor version bump while the fix commit type will trigger a patch version bump. If you add a ! after the commit type, the release will be a major version bump. For example, feat!: this is a breaking change will trigger a major version bump. Any other commit type will not trigger a release. This includes chore, docs, style, refactor, perf and test. If you still want to force a release, you can add a footer to any commit message with the Release-As: prefix. When a module is still in pre-release stage, the versioning is a bit different. The versioning is done manually through the Release-As: footer. We propose that for as long as the module is in pre-release stage, you should only do a Squash and Merge and add the Release-As: footer to the merge comment. The release PR will contain the version that you specified in the Release-As: footer. You can then approve and merge the release PR. For pre-release versioning, we propose to use v1.0.0-alpha.X or v1.0.0-beta.X, depending on the maturity. X is the pre-release version and is what should be incremented manually. When a module is ready for the first release, you need to add the Release-As: v1.0.0 footer and this will trigger the first release.

In particular, in the context of cloud resources, it allows to make sure all resources are managed centrally and destroyed in their proper context. This is important to control the financial consequences of numerous deployments. The DevOps Stack is strongly founded on the idea that every one of its components should be managed as code. As such, the underlying Kubernetes cluster and its components are managed with Terraform and the cluster applications are deployed using Helm charts orchestrated by Argo CD. This allows you to keep track of all changes made at any level of the stack, using Continuous Deployment in a GitOps approach.","title":"Infrastructure as Code","component":"ROOT","version":"v1.11.0","name":"infrastructure_as_code","url":"/latest/explanations/infrastructure_as_code.html","titles":[]},"11":{"id":11,"text":"It is not easy to describe the different phases of an IT project, especially when you also want to talk about operational aspects. One way to do this, which seems to be used more and more, is to talk about \"days\". To make it very simple, here are some explanations: Day 0 is related to software development, questions about requirements, architecture and design. Day 1 is more about deploying software developed in the Day 0 and starting to build and configure the hosting infrastructure. Day 2 is the time to go live and hope that the efforts made in Day 1 are adequate. This is a crucial moment, when it is imperative to have metrics, monitoring, tools and best practices to do efficient troubleshooting. For now, the DevOps Stack is very focused on the points relating to days 1 and 2, in particular, the aspects related to the provisioning of a Kubernetes platform as well as the mandatory services related to its operational management. We must also take into account that using the Cloud and Cloud Native development practices make it much easier to handle changes related to software life cycle. The boundaries and responsibilities between these different phases have become more blurred, less strict. In the near future, we really want to invest significantly in aspects related to day 0 by improving the DevOps Stack in that direction, especially the software factory and development best practices related to Kubernetes integration. This is closely linked to the generalization of the Twelve-Factor App methodology, as well as breaking silos and embracing DevOps principles. These good practices should be applied as early as possible in projects. It is absolutely necessary. The DevOps Stack provisions our Kubernetes clusters with a set of administration and monitoring tools out-of-the-box. Below you will find some of the services' dashboards. Whether you use AKS, EKS, or your local workstation using KinD, the DevOps Stack provisions the cluster with an Identity and Access Manager. For the case of a local KinD cluster, the DevOps Stack spawns a Keycloak instance. In a GitOps approach, the DevOps Stack uses Argo CD to continuously deploy all applications. The DevOps Stack ships with some pre-configured dashboards.","title":"Lifecycle Operations","component":"ROOT","version":"v1.11.0","name":"lifecycle_operations","url":"/latest/explanations/lifecycle_operations.html","titles":[{"text":"What \"days\" are all about","hash":"_what_days_are_all_about","id":1},{"text":"Developers need love","hash":"_developers_need_love","id":2},{"text":"Sysadmins want control","hash":"_sysadmins_want_control","id":3},{"text":"Identity Management Dashboard (Keycloak)","hash":"_identity_management_dashboard_keycloak","id":4},{"text":"User management with Keycloak","hash":"_user_management_with_keycloak","id":5},{"text":"Client management with Keycloak","hash":"_client_management_with_keycloak","id":6},{"text":"Continuous Deployment Dashboard (ArgoCD)","hash":"_continuous_deployment_dashboard_argocd","id":7},{"text":"Identity and Access Manager (Keycloak) deployment with Argo CD","hash":"_identity_and_access_manager_keycloak_deployment_with_argo_cd","id":8},{"text":"Monitoring Dashboards (Grafana)","hash":"_monitoring_dashboards_grafana","id":9},{"text":"Grafana dashboard for monitoring the K8s cluster","hash":"_grafana_dashboard_for_monitoring_the_k8s_cluster","id":10},{"text":"Grafana dashboard for monitoring cert-manager","hash":"_grafana_dashboard_for_monitoring_cert_manager","id":11}]},"12":{"id":12,"text":"Since about 2006, the IT industry has been totally disrupted by the conjunction of several factors, including the virtualization of resources and the possibility of obtaining them on-demand. This new way of managing IT resources is widely known as \"Cloud Computing\". It has become a kind of standard, or at least an objective pursued also by people wishing to maintain on-premises infrastructures. The long-awaited dream of finally being able to consider IT as a simple commodity. Well that’s what many believed. The concrete consequences of this revolution for IT companies like Camptocamp have mainly been the incredible growth in the number of resources to be provisioned and managed. Extensive process automation engaged by our teams allowed us to cope with such a growth without lowering our quality standards, therefore remaining competitive. We had no respite in this automation journey and made the best out of a thriving ecosystem of open source projects that address all the needs related to this paradigm shift. We have learned a lot during all these years and the DevOps Stack is our answer to implement our best practices in a containerized world where Kubernetes is the de facto standard for application platforms. Nowadays, the question is not so much whether there is software to solve a problem, but which one to use. Like a Linux distribution, we have container orchestrators (Kubernetes as a kernel) and many other projects revolving around it and offering different features. These features are sometimes oriented towards developers, operators or both (e.g. observability tools). As for a Linux distribution, what we need is consistency, components that work together and that are easy to install and maintain. But unlike a Linux distribution which is by definition server-centric, the promise of containers and Kubernetes is portability. The possibility of moving from one cloud (or on-prem infrastructure) to another, of distributing the workloads on different platforms. At the end, this DevOps Stack is simply a \"Cloud Agnostic Kubernetes Distribution\". The illustration above tries to show that while it is quite simple to manage one Kubernetes project, the complexity increases dramatically when you add more and more projects and you want to keep a certain homogeneity between them. The main problems observed are: It does not scale There is a lot of code duplications There is no implementation reference Improvements are not always backported to other projects It is very hard to maintain All projects will eventually diverge Each project points to different versions of dependencies This is not a new IT problem. Two decades ago, it was not really easy to manage thousands, or even hundreds of hosts in a homogeneous way. This problem has been successfully addressed by solutions like CFEngine, Puppet or more recently by Ansible. Today, we must adapt these principles for Kubernetes. There are many open source components out there, we just a smart way to interconnect them. By creating the DevOps Stack (a kind of abstraction layer), it becomes possible to instantiate all the components through a logical and coherent process. The main advantages are: It scales Minimal code duplication A reference implementation Improvements can be easily backported to other projects Dependency pining is done on the DevOps Stack to ensure reproducibility In the end, the DevOps Stack provides: A Playground to test/prototype new stuff related to k8s world An opinionated abstraction layer to deploy and manage our Kubernetes deployments Enforce DevOps best practices: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Configuration Management (CM) GitOps Continuous Integration (CI) Continuous Delivery (CD) Documentation as Code A consistent toolset Observability (monitoring, logging, alerting, trending) Continuous Delivery (change management + Git features) Dynamic Web Routing Dynamic Storage Provisioning Dynamic Certificate Management Authentication and Authorization With the following main features: Supports multiple Kubernetes distributions (AWS EKS, Azure AKS, Exoscale SKS and KinD for locals development and testing purposes); Supports blue/green or prod/qa/int/dev patterns; Infrastructure as Code with Terraform; Automatic deployment of \"core apps\" (cert-manager, Prometheus, AlertManager, Grafana, Loki, Traefik. etc.) in GitOps spirit with Argo CD; Central point of documentation deployed with Antora.","title":"Purpose of the DevOps Stack","component":"ROOT","version":"v1.11.0","name":"purpose","url":"/latest/explanations/purpose.html","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"_introduction","id":1},{"text":"Cloud Agnostic Kubernetes Distribution","hash":"_cloud_agnostic_kubernetes_distribution","id":2},{"text":"Without the DevOps Stack","hash":"_without_the_devops_stack","id":3},{"text":"With the DevOps Stack","hash":"_with_the_devops_stack","id":4},{"text":"Summary","hash":"_summary","id":5}]},"13":{"id":13,"text":"An example of a local deployment of a Kubernetes cluster on Azure AKS is provided here. Clone this repository and modify the files at your convenience. In the repository, as in a standard Terraform module, you will find the following files: terraform.tf - declaration of the Terraform providers used in this project; locals.tf - local variables used by the DevOps Stack modules; main.tf - definition of all the deployed modules; storage.tf - creation of the Storage Account and Storage Container used by Loki and Thanos; dns.tf - creation of the wildcard record for the ingresses of the DevOps Stack components; oidc.tf - addition of the redirect URIs to the Azure AD Enterprise Application in order to use it to authenticate to the DevOps Stack components providing a web interface; outputs.tf - the output variables of the DevOps Stack; The requirements folder is not part of the Terraform code you execute directly. Its importance is explained on the next section. On your local machine, you need to have the following tools installed: Azure CLI to login to your Azure account and interact with your AKS cluster; Terraform to provision the whole stack; kubectl or k9sto interact with your cluster; Other than that, you will require the following: An active Azure account with an active subscription; An Enterprise Application on Entra ID to use as an identity provider for the DevOps Stack components; The Azure subscription needs to have a Key Vault to store the secrets used to pass the credentials of said application to the DevOps Stack components; Your Azure account needs to be part of a user group that has been assigned the role Owner, Key Vault Reader and Key Vault Secrets User on the subscription; Your Azure account also needs to be an Owner of the Enterprise Application in order to add the proper redirect URIs. In this repository, you will find an example of Terraform code that could provision the required resources above. You can find this code here. Note that this code needs to be executed by an administrator with the proper rights on the on the subscription but also on Entra ID. An alternative to creating the required resources separately is that your user has an Application Developer role assignment on the Entra ID instance the subscription is linked to. This will allow you to create the Enterprise Application and add the redirect URIs directly with your code, without the need of an administrator. Check the application.tf from the tip above and adapt the Terraform resources in order to create the application yourself. Or simply create the Enterprise Application and add the redirect URIs manually. If you do not want to configure the remote Terraform state backend, you can simply remove the backend block from the terraform.tf file. More information about the remote backends is available on the official documentation. The DevOps Stack modules are developed with OIDC in mind. In production, you should have an identity provider that supports OIDC and use it to authenticate to the DevOps Stack applications. In this example, we use an Enterprise Applicaion as OIDC provider. You can use any other OIDC provider by adapting the oidc block in the locals.tf file with the proper values. By default, to avoid rate-limiting your domain by Let’s Encrypt, the example uses the letsencrypt-staging configuration of the cert-manager module to generate certificates. This uses the Let’s Encrypt staging environment which has an invalid CA certificate. If you feel ready to test with production certificates, you can simply edit the locals.tf file and change the cluster_issuer variable to letsencrypt-prod. Clone the repository and cd into the examples/aks folder; Login to your Azure account with the Azure CLI, set the proper subscription and verify you are connected it: az login az account set --subscription az account show Check out the modules you want to deploy in the main.tf file, and comment out the others; You can also add your own Terraform modules in this file or any other file on the root folder. A good place to start to write your own module is to clone the devops-stack-module-template repository and adapt it to your needs. From the source of the example deployment, initialize the Terraform modules and providers: terraform init Configure the variables in locals.tf to your preference: TIP: The cluster module documentation can help you know what to put in the kubernetes_version, for example. locals { # Parameters for the resources that are created outside this code, but still on the Azure subscription where the DevOps Stack will be deployed. default_resource_group = \"YOUR_DEFAULT_RESOURCE_GROUP\" # The default resource group where the Key Vault with the Azure AD application credentials is located. shared_key_vault_name = \"YOUR_KEY_VAULT_NAME\" # The name of the Key Vault with the Azure AD application credentials. oidc_application_name = \"YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME\" # The name of the Azure AD application that will be used for OIDC authentication. cluster_admins_group_object_id = \"38a1908d-0ccd-4acc-99d5-7f0228289752\" cluster_admins_group_object_id = \"YOUR_CLUSTER_ADMINS_GROUP_OBJECT_ID\" # Parameters used for this deployment of the DevOps Stack. common_resource_group = \"YOUR_COMMON_RESOURCE_GROUP\" # The resource group where the common resources will reside.

You can either set the flag as true in the locals.tf file or you can simply delete the line on the modules' declarations, since this variable is set as true by default on each module. Take note of the local called app_autosync. If you set the condition of the ternary operator to false you will disable the auto-sync for all the DevOps Stack modules. This allows you to choose when to manually sync the module on the Argo CD interface and is useful for troubleshooting purposes. To access your cluster, you need to use the Azure CLI to recover a Kubeconfig you can use: az aks get-credentials --resource-group YOUR_CLUSTER_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --name YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME --file ~/.kube/NAME_TO_GIVE_YOUR_CONFIG.config If you do not add your user’s or group’s object ID to the rbac_aad_admin_group_object_ids variable on the main.tf, you will need to use the --admin flag on the command above. This will give the privileged Kubeconfig to access the cluster. Then you can use the kubectl or k9s command to interact with the cluster: k9s --kubeconfig ~/.kube/NAME_TO_GIVE_YOUR_CONFIG.config As for the DevOps Stack applications, you can access them through the ingress domain that you can find in the ingress_domain output. If you used the code from the example without modifying the outputs, you will see something like this on your terminal after the terraform apply has done its job: Outputs: ingress_domain = \"your.domain.here\" Or you can use kubectl to get all the ingresses and their respective URLs: kubectl get ingress --all-namespaces --kubeconfig ~/.kube/NAME_TO_GIVE_YOUR_CONFIG.config To definitively stop the cluster on a single command, you can simply use the terraform destroy command. This will destroy all the resources created by the Terraform code, including the Kubernetes cluster. In some cases, you could encounter an error like these the first deployment: ╷ │ Error: error while waiting for application argocd to be created │ │ with module.argocd.argocd_application.this, │ on .terraform/modules/argocd/main.tf line 55, in resource \"argocd_application\" \"this\": │ 55: resource \"argocd_application\" \"this\" { │ │ error while waiting for application argocd to be synced and healthy: rpc error: code = Unavailable desc = error reading from server: EOF ╵ The error is due to the way we provision Argo CD on the final steps of the deployment. We use the bootstrap Argo CD to deploy the final Argo CD module, which causes a redeployment of Argo CD and consequently a momentary loss of connection between the Argo CD Terraform provider and the Argo CD server. You can simply re-run the command terraform apply to finalize the bootstrap of the cluster every time you encounter this error. If you encounter a loop when clicking on the login button on the Argo CD interface, you can try to delete the Argo CD server pod and let it be recreated.

The secrets.yml file contains the path to the the secret values on the gopass password store. On execution, the summon command will then read the secrets.yml file and pass the credentials as environment variables to the Terraform commands.

Check the AWS Cognito OIDC usage documentation for more information on how to use it.

In production, you should have an identity provider that supports OIDC and use it to authenticate to the DevOps Stack applications. You can have a local containing the OIDC configuration properly structured for the DevOps Stack applications and simply use an external OIDC provider instead of using Keycloak. Check this locals.tf on the Keycloak module for an example. To quickly deploy a testing environment on KinD you can use the Keycloak module, as shown in the example. After deploying Keycloak, you can use the OIDC bootstrap module to create the Keycloak realm, groups, users, etc. The user_map variable of that module allows you to create OIDC users used to authenticate to the DevOps Stack applications. The module will generate a password for each user, which you can check later after the deployment. If you do not provide a value for the user_map variable, the module will create a user named devopsadmin with a random password. Since KinD is deployed on your machine, there is no easy way of creating valid SSL certificates for the ingresses using Let’s Encrypt. As such, cert-manager is configured to use a self-signed Certificate Authority and the remaining modules are configured to ignore the SSL warnings/errors that are a consequence of that. When accessing the ingresses on your browser, you’ll obviously see warnings saying that the certificate is not valid. You can safely ignore them.

From the source of the example deployment, initialize Terraform, which downloads all required providers and modules locally (they will be stored in the hidden folder .terraform); terraform init Configure the variables in locals.tf to your preference: locals { kubernetes_version = \"v1.29.2\" cluster_name = \"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" base_domain = format(\"%s.nip.io\", replace(module.traefik.external_ip, \".\", \"-\")) subdomain = \"apps\" cluster_issuer = module.cert-manager.cluster_issuers.ca enable_service_monitor = false # Can be enabled after the first bootstrap. app_autosync = true ? { allow_empty = false, prune = true, self_heal = true } : {} } Finally, run terraform apply and accept the proposed changes to create the Kubernetes nodes as Docker containers, and populate them with our services; terraform apply After the first deployment (please note the troubleshooting step related with Argo CD), you can go to locals and enable the ServiceMonitor boolean to activate the Prometheus exporters that will send metrics to Prometheus; This flag needs to be set as false for the first bootstrap of the cluster, otherwise the applications will fail to deploy while the Custom Resource Definitions of the kube-prometheus-stack are not yet created. You can either set the flag as true in the locals.tf file or you can simply delete the line on the modules' declarations, since this variable is set as true by default on each module. Take note of the local called app_autosync. If you set the condition of the ternary operator to false you will disable the auto-sync for all the DevOps Stack modules. This allows you to choose when to manually sync the module on the Argo CD interface and is useful for troubleshooting purposes. Typically the KinD Terraform provider used in our code already appends the credentials to your default Kubeconfig, so you should be good to go to access the cluster. Otherwise, you can use the content of the kubernetes_kubeconfig output to manually generate a Kubeconfig file or you can use the one automatically created on the root folder of the project. Then you can use the kubectl or k9s command to interact with the cluster: k9s --kubeconfig /-config As for the DevOps Stack applications, you can access them through the ingress domain that you can find in the ingress_domain output. If you used the code from the example without modifying the outputs, you will see something like this on your terminal after the terraform apply has done its job: Outputs: ingress_domain = \"your.domain.here\" keycloak_admin_credentials = keycloak_users = kubernetes_kubeconfig = Or you can use kubectl to get all the ingresses and their respective URLs: kubectl get ingress --all-namespaces For example, if the base domain name is 172-19-0-1.nip.io, the applications are accessible at the following adresses: https://grafana.apps.172-19-0-1.nip.io https://alertmanager.apps.172-19-0-1.nip.io https://prometheus.apps.172-19-0-1.nip.io https://keycloak.apps.172-19-0-1.nip.io https://minio.apps.172-19-0-1.nip.io https://argocd.apps.172-19-0-1.nip.io https://thanos-bucketweb.apps.172-19-0-1.nip.io https://thanos-query.apps.172-19-0-1.nip.io You can access the applications using the credentials created by the Keycloak module. They are written to the Terraform output: # List all outputs $ terraform output keycloak_admin_credentials = keycloak_users = kubernetes_kubeconfig = minio_root_user_credentials = # To get the credentials for Grafana, Prometheus, etc. $ terraform output keycloak_users { \"devopsadmin\" = \"PASSWORD\" } The docker pause command can be used to halt the cluster for a while in order to save energy (replace kind-cluster by the cluster name you defined in locals.tf): # Pause the cluster: docker pause kind-cluster-control-plane kind-cluster-worker{,2,3} # Resume the cluster: docker unpause kind-cluster-control-plane kind-cluster-worker{,2,3} When the host computer is restarted, the Docker container will start again, but the cluster will not resume correctly. It has to be destroyed and recreated. To definitively stop the cluster on a single command (that is the reason we delete some resources from the state file), you can use the following command: terraform state rm $(terraform state list | grep \"argocd_application\\|argocd_project\\|kubernetes_\\|helm_\\|keycloak_\") && terraform destroy A dirtier alternative is to directly destroy the Docker containers and volumes (replace kind-cluster by the cluster name you defined in locals.tf): # Stop and remove Docker containers docker container stop kind-cluster-control-plane kind-cluster-worker{,2,3} && docker container rm -v kind-cluster-control-plane kind-cluster-worker{,2,3} # Remove the Terraform state file rm terraform.state That’s it, you have deployed the DevOps Stack locally! For more information, keep on reading the documentation. You can explore the possibilities of each module and get the link to the source code on their respective documentation pages. In some cases, you could encounter an error like this the first deployment: ╷ │ Error: Error while waiting for application argocd to be created │ │ with module.argocd.argocd_application.this, │ on .terraform/modules/argocd/main.tf line 55, in resource \"argocd_application\" \"this\": │ 55: resource \"argocd_application\" \"this\" { │ │ error while waiting for application argocd to be synced and healthy: rpc error: code = Unavailable desc = connection error: desc = \"transport: error while dialing: dial tcp 127.0.0.1:45729: connect: connection refused\" ╵ This error is due to the way we provision Argo CD on the final steps of the deployment. We use the bootstrap Argo CD to deploy the final Argo CD module, which causes a redeployment of Argo CD and consequently a momentary loss of connection between the Argo CD Terraform provider and the Argo CD server. You can simply re-run the command terraform apply to finalize the bootstrap of the cluster. For more informations about the Argo CD module, please refer to the respective documentation page. If you encounter a loop when clicking on the login button on the Argo CD interface, you can try to delete the Argo CD server pod and let it be recreated.

Clone this repository and modify the files at your convenience. In the repository, as in a standard Terraform module, you will find the following files: terraform.tf - declaration of the Terraform providers used in this project as well as their configuration; locals.tf - local variables used by the DevOps Stack modules; variables.tf - definition of the variables that pass the credentials required for the S3 provider; main.tf - definition of all the deployed modules; dns.tf - definition of some of the DNS resources required for the base domain; s3_buckets.tf - creation of the required S3 buckets needed by Longhorn, Loki and Thanos; outputs.tf - the output variables of the DevOps Stack, e.g. credentials and the .kubeconfig file to use with kubectl; On your local machine, you need to have the following tools installed: Terraform to provision the whole stack; kubectl or k9sto interact with your cluster; Exoscale CLI to interact with your Exoscale account; gopass and summon to easily pass the IAM secrets as environment variables when running terraform commands; Other than that, you will require the following: an Exoscale account; an Exoscale IAM key with at least the tags Compute, DBAAS, DNS, IAM and SOS, which you can create in the Exoscale portal (you can use your personal administrator IAM key, but it is best you create a dedicated IAM key for this deployment); a domain name and a DNS subscription on the Exoscale account; an AWS account and associated IAM key in order to have a S3 bucket and DynamoDB to store the Terraform state (optional you if you choose to store the Terraform state locally, which is not recommended in production); Check this blog post for more information on how to configure gopass and summon to work together. For simplicity and ease of use, as well as security, the example uses gopass and summon to pass the IAM credentials to the Terraform commands. The secrets.yml file contains the path to the the secret values on the gopass password store. On execution, the summon command will then read the secrets.yml file and pass the credentials as environment variables to the Terraform commands. The commands presented on this tutorial all use the summon command. If you do not want to configure the remote Terraform state backend, you can simply remove the backend block from the terraform.tf file. Exoscale has an example for configuring Terraform to use SOS buckets as a backend for the Terraform state. However, at the time of writing, SOS buckets did not support encryption and there was no equivalent to DynamoDB to have the state lock feature, so in the end we preferred to use S3 buckets on AWS as a backend. More information about the remote backends is available on the official documentation. The Simple Object Storage (SOS) service provided by Exoscale follows the S3 specification. The Exoscale provider does not provide a way to create S3 buckets on their service. As recommended by their documentation, you have to use the AWS provider to create the S3 buckets. Since we are already using the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables to configure the Terraform backend, we cannot use them to configure the aws provider to create the S3 buckets. Because of that, we have to have two Terraform variables, exoscale_iam_key and exoscale_iam_secret, to pass the Exoscale IAM credentials to the aws provider. The values of these two variables are then set using the TF_VAR_exoscale_iam_key and TF_VAR_exoscale_iam_secret environment variables. Your aws provider configuration should then look something like this: provider \"aws\" { endpoints { s3 = \"https://sos-${local.zone}.exo.io\" } region = local.zone access_key = var.exoscale_iam_key secret_key = var.exoscale_iam_secret # Skip validations specific to AWS in order to use this provider for Exoscale services skip_credentials_validation = true skip_requesting_account_id = true skip_metadata_api_check = true skip_region_validation = true } If you are not using the remote Terraform state, you can use the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables with the Exoscale IAM key to then configure the aws provider. Don not forget to remove the access_key and secret_key values from said provider block. As-is, the code from the example requires a DNS subscription on the Exoscale account and unique domain in order to create a DNS zone on the Exoscale DNS service. You can bypass this requirement by deleting the dns.tf file and by not passing a value to the base_domain variable of the cluster module. This will make the cluster module return you a nip.io domain prefixed with the IP of the NLB It is for this reason that every other DevOps Stack module receives the base_domain variable from the output module.sks.base_domain instead of using the local.base_domain. Check the cluster module documentation for more information on the base_domain variable. The DevOps Stack modules are developed with OIDC in mind. In production, you should have an identity provider that supports OIDC and use it to authenticate to the DevOps Stack applications. You can have a local containing the OIDC configuration properly structured for the DevOps Stack applications and simply use an external OIDC provider instead of using Keycloak. Check this locals.tf on the Keycloak module for an example. To quickly deploy a testing environment on SKS you can use the Keycloak module, as shown in the example. After deploying Keycloak, you can use the OIDC bootstrap module to create the Keycloak realm, groups, users, etc. The user_map variable of that module allows you to create OIDC users used to authenticate to the DevOps Stack applications. The module will generate a password for each user, which you can check later after the deployment. If you do not provide a value for the user_map variable, the module will create a user named devopsadmin with a random password. By default, to avoid rate-limiting your domain by Let’s Encrypt, the example uses the letsencrypt-staging configuration of the cert-manager module to generate certificates. This uses the Let’s Encrypt staging environment which has an invalid CA certificate. If you feel ready to test with production certificates, you can simply edit the locals.tf file and change the cluster_issuer variable to letsencrypt-prod. Clone the repository and cd into the examples/sks folder; Adapt the secrets.yml file to point to the correct path on your gopass password store; Check out the modules you want to deploy in the main.tf file, and comment out the others; You can also add your own Terraform modules in this file or any other file on the root folder. A good place to start to write your own module is to clone the devops-stack-module-template repository and adapt it to your needs. On the oidc module, adapt the user_map variable as you wish (please check the OIDC section for more information). From the source of the example deployment, initialize the Terraform modules and providers: summon terraform init Configure the variables in locals.tf to your preference: The cluster_name must be unique for each DevOps Stack deployment in a single Exoscale account. The cluster module documentation can help you know what to put in the kubernetes_version, zone and service_level variables. locals { kubernetes_version = \"1.30.2\" cluster_name = \"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" # Must be unique for each DevOps Stack deployment in a single account. zone = \"YOUR_CLUSTER_ZONE\" service_level = \"starter\" base_domain = \"your.domain.here\" subdomain = \"apps\" activate_wildcard_record = true cluster_issuer = module.cert-manager.cluster_issuers.staging letsencrypt_issuer_email = \"YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS\" enable_service_monitor = false # Can be enabled after the first bootstrap. app_autosync = true ? { allow_empty = false, prune = true, self_heal = true } : {} } Finally, run terraform apply and accept the proposed changes to create the Kubernetes nodes on Exoscale SKS and populate them with our services; summon terraform apply After the first deployment (please note the troubleshooting step related with kube-prometheus-stack and Argo CD), you can go to the locals.tf and enable the ServiceMonitor boolean to activate the Prometheus exporters that will send metrics to Prometheus; This flag needs to be set as false for the first bootstrap of the cluster, otherwise the applications will fail to deploy while the Custom Resource Definitions of the kube-prometheus-stack are not yet created. You can either set the flag as true in the locals.tf file or you can simply delete the line on the modules' declarations, since this variable is set as true by default on each module. Take note of the local called app_autosync. If you set the condition of the ternary operator to false you will disable the auto-sync for all the DevOps Stack modules. This allows you to choose when to manually sync the module on the Argo CD interface and is useful for troubleshooting purposes. You can use the content of the kubernetes_kubeconfig output to manually generate a Kubeconfig file or you can use the Exoscale CLI to recover a new one. Note that if you use the kubernetes_kubeconfig output, you will be using exactly the same credentials that the Terraform code uses to interact with the cluster, so it’s best to avoid it. To use the Exoscale CLI, you can run the following command: summon exo compute sks kubeconfig YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME kube-admin --zone YOUR_CLUSTER_ZONE --group system:masters > ~/.kube/NAME_TO_GIVE_YOUR_CONFIG.config Then you can use the kubectl or k9s command to interact with the cluster: k9s --kubeconfig ~/.kube/NAME_TO_GIVE_YOUR_CONFIG.config As for the DevOps Stack applications, you can access them through the ingress domain that you can find in the ingress_domain output. If you used the code from the example without modifying the outputs, you will see something like this on your terminal after the terraform apply has done its job: Outputs: ingress_domain = \"your.domain.here\" keycloak_admin_credentials = keycloak_users = kubernetes_kubeconfig = Or you can use kubectl to get all the ingresses and their respective URLs: kubectl get ingress --all-namespaces --kubeconfig ~/.kube/NAME_TO_GIVE_YOUR_CONFIG.config The password for the Keycloak admin user is available in the keycloak_admin_credentials output and the users are available in the keycloak_users output: summon terraform output keycloak_users To definitively stop the cluster on a single command (that is the reason we delete some resources from the state file), you can use the following command: summon terraform state rm $(summon terraform state list | grep \"argocd_application\\|argocd_project\\|kubernetes_\\|helm_\\|keycloak_\") && summon terraform destroy That’s it, you now have a fully functional Kubernetes cluster in Exoscale SKS with the DevOps Stack applications deployed on it.

The module creates an Argo CD AppProject using the name given on declaration and then creates an Argo CD Application using the chart that is inside the path for the Git repository that is declared. Inside that folder, the module expects an Helm chart with a folder structure similar to the following (as is standard practice): application_folder ├── Chart.yaml ├── charts │ ├── dependency1.tar.gz │ └── dependency2.tar.gz ├── secrets.yaml ├── templates │ ├── template1.yaml │ ├── template2.yaml │ ├── template3.yaml │ └── _helpers.tpl └── values.yaml By default, the created AppProject can only create an Application within a Namespace of the same name or within a Namespace declared on the module declaration. Besides that, the AppProject has the permission to create any kind of Kubernetes resources inside the destination cluster, but you can restrict the allowed resources if you need to. This module can be declared by adding the following block on your Terraform configuration: module \"module_name\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-application.git?ref=\" name = \"application-name\" argocd_namespace = module.argocd_bootstrap.argocd_namespace source_repo = \"https://address.com/owner/repository.git\" source_repo_path = \"path/to/chart\" source_target_revision = \"branch\" dependency_ids = { argocd = module.argocd.id } } A more complex declaration, that defines the Namespace and also the AppProject allowed resources, would look like this: module \"module_name\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-application.git?ref=\" name = \"application-name\" argocd_namespace = module.argocd_bootstrap.argocd_namespace source_repo = \"https://address.com/owner/repository.git\" source_repo_path = \"path/to/chart\" source_target_revision = \"branch\" destination_namespace = \"namespace\" project_cluster_resource_whitelist = [ { group = \"*\" kind = \"Namespace\" }, ] project_namespace_resource_whitelist = [ { group = \"apps\" kind = \"Deployment\" }, { group = \"*\" kind = \"Service\" }, ] dependency_ids = { argocd = module.argocd.id } } Furthermore, you can customize the chart’s values.yaml by adding an Helm configuration as an HCL structure: module \"module_name\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-application.git?ref=\" name = \"application-name\" argocd_namespace = module.argocd_bootstrap.argocd_namespace source_repo = \"https://address.com/owner/repository.git\" source_repo_path = \"path/to/chart\" source_target_revision = \"branch\" helm_values = [{ # Note the curly brackets here map = { string = \"string\" bool = true } sequence = [ { key1 = \"value1\" key2 = \"value2\" }, { key1 = \"value1\" key2 = \"value2\" }, ] sequence2 = [ \"string1\", \"string2\" ] }] dependency_ids = { argocd = module.argocd.id } } When your charts are stored inside a private repository, Argo CD needs to have the credentials necessary to have at least read access to the contents of the repository. This module has 2 variables you can use for that, depending on the type of credentials you want to configure, either HTTPS or SSH. You’ll need to pass a string containing a private SSH key in the variable source_credentials_ssh_key (you can pass the value however you want, as long as it is a string) and the repository needs to be of the type git@address.com:owner/repository. Do not hardcode your SSH private key like in the example below! Either create the SSH key using Terraform and pass the output directly or use SOPS to store and pass the key as a secret. module \"module_name\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-application.git?ref=\" name = \"application-name\" argocd_namespace = module.argocd_bootstrap.argocd_namespace source_repo = \"git@address.com:owner/repository\" source_repo_path = \"path/to/chart\" source_target_revision = \"branch\" source_credentials_ssh_key = \"-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----\\nfoo\\nbar\\n-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----\" dependency_ids = { argocd = module.argocd.id } } You’ll need to pass the username and password inside the variable source_credentials_https and the repository needs to be of the type https://address.com/owner/repository. Do not hardcode your password like in the example below! It is recommended to pass the value as secret, either using SOPS or another provider. Another best practice would be to use a token you created on Github.com (or another provider) that has the least amount of access needed (in this use-case, Argo CD only needs read access). module \"module_name\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-application.git?ref=\" name = \"application-name\" argocd_namespace = module.argocd_bootstrap.argocd_namespace source_repo = \"https://address.com/owner/repository.git\" source_repo_path = \"path/to/chart\" source_target_revision = \"branch\" source_credentials_https = { username = \"your_username\" password = \"your_token_password\" https_insecure = false } dependency_ids = { argocd = module.argocd.id } } As this is an application, it needs to be deployed after the deployment of Argo CD and consequently this module needs to have this explicit dependency.

If you define this variable, any value passed in the project_dest_cluster_name variable is ignored. Type: string Default: null Description: Namespace where the application will be deployed. By default it is the same as the application’s name defined by var.name. We use a ternary operator to conditionally define the Namespace only if it is defined on the module’s instantiation: namespace = var.destination_namespace == null ? var.name : var.destination_namespace. Type: string Default: null Description: Cluster-scoped resources allowed to be deployed in the Argo CD AppProject created by the module. The group must be a Kubernetes API group such as core or apps and the kind must be a Kubernetes Kinds/Object Schemas such as Namespace or ClusterRole (note that only resources like these ones are compatible with this setting, the other resources are only Namespace-scoped).

The Argo CD chart used by this module is shipped in this repository as well, in order to avoid any unwanted behaviors caused by unsupported versions. Current Chart Version Original Repository Default Values 5.27.1 Chart values.yaml The root of this repository contains the final Argo CD module to be deployed, which uses a Terraform provider for Argo CD to deploy the Argo CD chart. On the first deployment of a cluster, you’ll want to use the bootstrap module instead. Check the bootstrap module’s documentation for more information. To deploy the final Argo CD module, you’ll need to add the following declaration on your Terraform configuration: module \"argocd\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-argocd.git?ref=\" cluster_name = local.cluster_name base_domain = local.base_domain cluster_issuer = local.cluster_issuer admin_enabled = \"true\" namespace = module.argocd_bootstrap.argocd_namespace accounts_pipeline_tokens = module.argocd_bootstrap.argocd_accounts_pipeline_tokens server_secretkey = module.argocd_bootstrap.argocd_server_secretkey dependency_ids = { argocd = module.argocd_bootstrap.id traefik = module.traefik.id cert-manager = module.cert-manager.id oidc = module.oidc.id kube-prometheus-stack = module.kube-prometheus-stack.id } } A more complex declaration, that includes a OIDC configuration for the login (this way you avoid having to login using the admin password found on a Kubernetes secret) and the configuration of some other source repositories, would be: module \"argocd\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-argocd.git?ref=\" ... oidc = { name = \"OIDC\" issuer = module.oidc.oidc.issuer_url clientID = module.oidc.oidc.client_id clientSecret = module.oidc.oidc.client_secret requestedIDTokenClaims = { groups = { essential = true } } requestedScopes = [ \"openid\", \"profile\", \"email\" ] } repositories = { cluster-apps = { ... } user-apps = { ... } } ... } The sources can also be configured using the Application and ApplicationSet modules. You can also overload the policy.csv as shown in the following example: module \"argocd\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-argocd.git?ref=\" ... rbac = { policy_csv = (known after apply) # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) ~ metadata { ... } ~ spec { ... } } Plan: 1 to add, 1 to change, 1 to destroy. Untainting the resource with the command terraform untaint module.argocd.argocd_application.this should solve the issue. If you encounter a loop when clicking on the login button on the Argo CD interface, you can try to delete the Argo CD server pod and let it be recreated. This error usually happens because there are some unapplied settings between the bootstrap Argo CD and the final Argo CD module. If you already encountered the error from the previous step, then this error should not happen, as it means the pod was already recreated. Obviously, this module needs an already working Argo CD (the bootstrap), so it depends on module.argocd_bootstrap. Since there is an ingress deployed with this module, it needs to be deployed after Traefik so it depends on module.ingress. For the same reason as the previous dependency, it needs to be deployed after cert-manager so it depends on module.cert-manager. Only for the platforms that deploy a OIDC module, such as EKS, KinD or SKS, there is also a the dependency on module.oidc.id. Finally, the kube-prometheus-stack is a requirement because this Argo CD module requires the ServiceMonitor CRD so it depends on module.kube-prometheus-stack.

You can also configure the minimum and maximum replicas desired or leave the default values. Activating the HA mode automatically enables the Redis HA chart which requires at least 3 worker nodes, as this chart enforces Pods to run on separate nodes.

Activating the HA mode automatically enables the Redis HA chart which requires at least 3 worker nodes, as this chart enforces Pods to run on separate nodes.

The Argo CD installed is the same as the one deployed by the Argo CD module, however this module deploys it using the Helm provider for Terraform, since the Argo CD provider cannot be obviously used until it installed. To do that, on your Terraform configuration you can declare the module as such: module \"argocd_bootstrap\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-argocd.git//bootstrap?ref=\" # Note here that you should mark the module as depending on the module that deployed the cluster depends_on = [module.eks] } Do not forget to add the Argo CD provider settings, which is needed to deploy all the other modules, since they this Terraform to deploy the Argo CD applications: provider \"argocd\" { auth_token = module.argocd_bootstrap.argocd_auth_token port_forward_with_namespace = module.argocd_bootstrap.argocd_namespace insecure = true plain_text = true kubernetes { ... } } By default, all the modules of the DevOps Stack create their own AppProject to deploy the Argo CD Application deployed by the module. Since the version 3.5.0 of this module, the bootstrap module now supports creating AppProjects for a given map of projects passed in the variable argocd_projects. The DevOps Stack modules then can be configured to use this unified AppProject instead of creating on for each application. By default, the AppProjects created by this module do not contain restrictions for the destination namespace or source repositories, but you can change that behavior by configuring the allowed_source_repos and allowed_namespaces values on the argocd_projects map. This process requires a few manual steps, because Terraform will try to delete the old AppProjects before referencing the Applications to the new AppProject. To accomplish this, do the following: Create the new AppProject with the argocd_projects variable, and apply the changes. Use the Argo CD web interface or edit the Application objects using K9s or kubectl and move each Application to the new project you created. Modify the module instantiations for each module and add the argocd_project variable to set the Application to use the new AppProject. Run a terraform apply again. This time, the only changes you should see is the deletion of the old AppProjects.

This module uses the Terraform module \"aks\" by Azure to in order to deploy and manage an AKS cluster. It was created in order to also manage other resources required by the DevOps Stack, such as the DNS records, resource group and subnet specific to the cluster created (these resources are helpful for the blue/green upgrading strategy). The module also provides the necessary outputs to be used by the other DevOps Stack modules. By default, this module creates the AKS control plane and a default node pool composed of 3 nodes of the type Standard_D2s_v3. If no version is specified, the AKS cluster and node pool will be created with the latest available version. The variable kubernetes_version sets the version of the AKS control plane while the orchestrator_version variable sets the version of the default node pool. The node_pools variable allows you to define the extra node pools you want deployed besides the default one. For each extra node pool you can also define the version of Kubernetes to use with the orchestrator_version variable. Note that the versions of the node pools cannot be higher than the control plane. This module can be used with the following declaration: module \"aks\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-cluster-aks.git?ref=\" cluster_name = local.cluster_name base_domain = local.base_domain location = resource.azurerm_resource_group.main.location resource_group_name = resource.azurerm_resource_group.main.name virtual_network_name = resource.azurerm_virtual_network.this.name cluster_subnet = local.cluster_subnet kubernetes_version = local.kubernetes_version sku_tier = local.sku_tier rbac_aad_admin_group_object_ids = [ ENTRA_ID_GROUP_UUID, ] depends_on = [resource.azurerm_resource_group.main] Multiple node pools can be defined with the node_pools variable: module \"aks\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-cluster-aks.git?ref=\" cluster_name = local.cluster_name base_domain = local.base_domain location = resource.azurerm_resource_group.main.location resource_group_name = resource.azurerm_resource_group.main.name virtual_network_name = resource.azurerm_virtual_network.this.name cluster_subnet = local.cluster_subnet kubernetes_version = local.kubernetes_version sku_tier = local.sku_tier rbac_aad_admin_group_object_ids = [ ENTRA_ID_GROUP_UUID, ] # Extra node pools node_pools = { extra = { vm_size = \"Standard_D2s_v3\" node_count = 2 }, } depends_on = [resource.azurerm_resource_group.main] } From our experience, usually, enabling the auto-upgrades is a good practice, but up to a point. We recommend enabling the auto-upgrades for the control plane and the node pools. To upgrade between minor versions, you are required to first upgrade the control plane and then the node pools. This is because the node pools cannot be of a higher version than the control plane. If using the orchestrator_version variable for the default or extra node pools, unfortunately, for reasons that escape our comprehension, the upgrade of the control plane through the Terraform code will not work. You would have to manually upgrade the control plane through the Azure portal. This is why we recommend leaving the orchestrator_version variables as null and follow the procedure below. Our recommended procedure for upgrading the cluster is as follows: Ensure that the orchestrator_version is not set in any part of your code. Go to the Azure portal and select your cluster. Then on the overview tab, click on the version of the control plane ans you should see a page like below. Click on Upgrade version. Afterwards, on the next screen, select the next minor version, make sure you’ve selected to upgrade the control plane and all the node pools, then start. Wait for all the components to finish the upgrade. Then, you can set the kubernetes_version variable to the minor version which you’ve just upgraded to and apply the Terraform code. This will reconcile the Terraform state with the actual state of the cluster. You can enable automatic upgrades of the control plane and node pools by setting the automatic_channel_upgrade variable to a desired value. This will automatically upgrade the control plane and node pools to the latest available version given the constraints you defined in said variable. You can also specify the maintenance_window variable to set a maintenance window for the upgrades. An example of this settings is as follows: automatic_channel_upgrade = \"patch\" maintenance_window = { allowed = [ { day = \"Sunday\", hours = [22, 23] }, ] not_allowed = [] } You can also set the node_os_channel_upgrade variable and maintenance_window_node_os variables to upgrade the Kubernetes Cluster Nodes' OS Image.

Here is an example that creates one EKS managed node group with 3 instances of type r5a.large, attaches them to the cluster Load Balancer(s), and customizes the base EBS volume size to 100 GB: node_groups = { \"my-node-group\" = { instance_types = [\"r5a.xlarge\"] min_size = 3 max_size = 3 desired_size = 3 nlbs_attachment = true block_device_mappings = { \"default\" = { device_name = \"/dev/xvda\" ebs = { volume_size = 100 } } } }, } When using self-managed node groups, the instance type is instead given as a single string value instead of an array: instance_type = \"r5a.xlarge\" You can check out available instance types on the official AWS documentation pages. Depending on the create_public_nlb and create_private_nlb variables, it creates a public and/or public Network Load Balancer(s). The node groups that have the target_group_arns = module.my_cluster.nlb_target_groups value set will be added as backends of the LBs. By default, the LBs only forward traffic on the ports 80 and 443, but you can customize this using the extra_lb_target_groups and extra_lb_http_tcp_listeners variables to add other ports. Look at the lb.tf file in this module for the syntax. This module needs a Route 53 DNS zone in the same AWS account to create a wildcard CNAME record that points to the Network LB. The DNS zone must be passed in the base_domain variable. This record is used by other DevOps Stack modules as default URLs for their applications. The versions 2.x and earlier of this module created self-managed node groups exclusively. Upgrading to versions 3.x or later requires setting the variable use_self_managed_node_groups to true to avoid breaking existing clusters. When going from self-managed node groups to EKS managed ones, note the following changes in node groups arguments: The instance_type argument is replaced with instance_types and accepts a list of strings, The target_group_arns argument isn’t supported anymore. Instead set nlbs_attachment = true. Switching an existing cluster to EKS managed node groups is possible, but requires manually draining the existing nodes after the new node group is created and before the old one is destroyed (by doing a terraform apply -target in multiple steps).

This cluster module is mainly used to deploy a Kubernetes cluster used for testing and development as well as for onboarding new users of the DevOps Stack. KinD is nothing more than a local Kubernetes cluster using Docker container \"nodes\". As such, it is required that you have Docker up and running on your machine (the documentation to install Docker is available here here). An example of a deployment of the DevOps Stack using KinD is available here as well as an accompanying quick tutorial. This module can be declared by adding the following block on your Terraform configuration: module \"kind\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-kind.git?ref=\" cluster_name = local.cluster_name } You can configure the version of Kubernetes by passing the variable kubernetes_version. This variable is nothing more than the tag of the image that is to be deployed. You can see the usable versions in Docker Hub. module \"kind\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-kind.git?ref=\" cluster_name = local.cluster_name kubernetes_version = \"1.29.1\" } By default, this module deploys a cluster with a control plane node and 3 worker nodes. If you want to deploy one more worker node, you can do it like this: module \"kind\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-kind.git?ref=\" cluster_name = local.cluster_name nodes = [ { \"platform\" = \"devops-stack\" }, { \"platform\" = \"devops-stack\" }, { \"platform\" = \"devops-stack\" }, { \"platform\" = \"devops-stack\" }, ] } Obviously, since this module deploys the cluster, it does not depend on any other module of the DevOps Stack. The only thing you’ll probably want to configure are some locals with some common variables used on all the modules: locals { kubernetes_version = \"v1.29.0\" cluster_name = \"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" base_domain = format(\"%s.nip.io\", replace(module.traefik.external_ip, \".\", \"-\")) cluster_issuer = \"ca-issuer\" } The following requirements are needed by this module: docker (>= 2.23.1) kind (>= 0.1.0) The following providers are used by this module: kind (>= 0.1.0) docker (>= 2.23.1) The following resources are used by this module: kind_cluster.cluster (resource) docker_network.kind (data source) The following input variables are optional (have default values): Description: The name to give to the cluster.

The module creates a Kubernetes cluster with the node pools passed as input. It also creates anti-affinity group for each node pool, a Network Load Balancer (NLB), and a security group for the entire cluster. This module can be used with the following declaration: module \"sks\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-cluster-sks.git?ref=\" cluster_name = local.cluster_name kubernetes_version = local.kubernetes_version zone = local.zone base_domain = local.base_domain nodepools = { \"${local.cluster_name}-default\" = { size = 3 instance_type = \"standard.large\" description = \"Default node pool for ${local.cluster_name}.\" instance_prefix = \"default\" }, } } A minimum of a single node pool with 3 nodes is required. See the Persistent Volumes section for more information. Multiple node pools and with more complex settings can be declared. The following example adds a node pool with a taint and label to be used exclusively for monitoring workloads: module \"sks\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-cluster-sks.git?ref=\" cluster_name = local.cluster_name kubernetes_version = local.kubernetes_version zone = local.zone base_domain = local.base_domain nodepools = { \"${local.cluster_name}-default\" = { size = 3 instance_type = \"standard.large\" description = \"Default node pool for ${local.cluster_name}.\" instance_prefix = \"default\" }, \"${local.cluster_name}-monitoring\" = { size = 2 instance_type = \"standard.large\" description = \"Monitoring node pool for ${local.cluster_name}.\" instance_prefix = \"monitoring\" disk_size = 150 labels = { role = \"monitoring\" } taints = { nodepool = \"monitoring:NoSchedule\" } }, } } You can consult the available instance types on the Pricing page of Exoscale. Note that not all instance types are available in all zones and take note of the these limitations of SKS. The module uses the exoscale_sks_kubeconfig resource to get a Kubeconfig with administrator privileges on the cluster. We use this configuration file to parse the credentials needed to set the providers on the caller module. If the variable create_kubeconfig_file is activated, a local file is created with the Kubeconfig content, which can be used to interact with the cluster. You can still get the Kubeconfig’s important values from the outputs kubernetes_*. The validity of the client certificate is limited to 30 days by default and the earliest time for renewal is 10 days. This means that if no terraform apply is run between the 10th and 30th days after the last terraform apply, the Kubeconfig will be invalid and the next on will fail. There are variables available to customize these values to suit your needs. In the case that you have left your Kubeconfig pass the expiry time, you can still get a new one by running a targeted terraform apply on the module: $ terraform apply -target module.sks.exoscale_sks_kubeconfig.this In production, this module requires a domain name to be passed in the base_domain variable. This module will take care to create a CNAME record that points to the NLB, using the cluster name as an hostname. The DNS zone should be created outside this module and it requires a DNS Subscription in the same Exoscale account. This can be added on the Exoscale portal, on the DNS tab. The subscription needs to be manually activated on the web interface, but it is recommended that the DNS zone is created on your root Terraform module. Check the Terraform code of the SKS example to learn how to create the DNS zone. If no value is passed to the base_domain variable, the module will create a nip.io domain prefixed with the IP of the NLB. You can check said domain in the base_domain output. The NLB is created in this module without any service associated. The NLB services are created by the Exoscale Cloud Controller Manager (CCM), which is deployed by default on SKS clusters. The CCM takes into account annotations on the LoadBalancer services to create the corresponding services on the NLB. These annotations are added by the Traefik module and for that reason you need to pass the outputs nlb_id, router_nodepool_id and router_instance_pool_id from this module to the Traefik module. Check the official documentation of the CCM and this blog post to learn more. An example is also provided by Exoscale on the SKS documentation, which contains the required annotations as well was a few interesting comments. This module requires that you deploy Longhorn in order to have a way to provision persistent volumes for your workloads. We configured the Longhorn module to replicate the volumes at least 3 times throughout the available nodes. For that reason, you need to deploy at least a node pool with minimum 3 nodes. The official documentation is a good starting point to understand the upgrade process of SKS clusters. On your root Terraform code change the Kubernetes version deployed by your SKS module and do a terraform apply. This will upgrade the version of the control plane of the SKS cluster. Scale up all your node pools (router one included) through the size parameter on the nodepools and router_nodepool variables to twice their original size and do a terraform apply. Wait for all new nodes to be in a ready state and check that their Kubernetes version match the one you configured. Check in Longhorn Dashboard that all the nodes are schedulable. It is advised you to do a backup of all your volumes in case of troubles during the upgrade to avoid losing your applications persistent volumes. In the Longhorn dashboard, go to the Volume tab, select all your volumes and select Update Replicas Count action. In the dialog box, replace the actual replicas count of these volumes by twice your old schedulable node count (by default it’s 3) in order to replicate your volumes on the new nodes. Cordon all the old nodes and start draining them one by one using kubectl drain --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data --timeout=1m . This will move all the pods to the new nodes. When all the old nodes are drained and all pods are deployed to new nodes, do a terraform refresh. If you use a Keycloak module provisioned by Terraform with Keycloak provider you should have diffs on Keycloak’s resources. Apply them. Before deleting the old nodes, be sure to test and validate your cluster health! Once you’re confident enough, you can restore original node pool sizes in Terraform and apply. This will delete the old nodes. Finally, go to the Longhorn dashboard, restore the original replicas count for every volumes and check that every volumes are in healthy state. SKS instance pools will automatically choose cordoned nodes to delete in priority.

It is meant to be used mainly for testing purposes when deploying a local cluster using KinD. This repository contains 2 charts: keycloak-operator: contains the CRDs and the other Kubernetes resources in order to install the operator as recommended for a vanilla Kubernetes installation in Keycloak’s documentation; keycloak: installs Keycloak and associated resources (such as an ingress) as well as PostgreSQL deployment (optional if you provide the credentials for an external database). The Keycloak version installed is the 20.0.3. Here you will find the official guides of Keycloak, namely the ones used for this module in the Operator section. Besides this module, we developed a submodule to bootstrap a realm, groups and users so you can be up an running as fast as possible. This module can be declared by adding the following block on your Terraform configuration (below is an example when using KinD, but nothing stops you of using this module with the other cluster modules of the DevOps Stack): module \"keycloak\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-keycloak.git?ref=\" cluster_name = local.cluster_name base_domain = format(\"%s.nip.io\", replace(module.ingress.external_ip, \".\", \"-\")) cluster_issuer = local.cluster_issuer argocd_namespace = module.argocd_bootstrap.argocd_namespace dependency_ids = { traefik = module.ingress.id cert-manager = module.cert-manager.id } } We do not recommend using the PostgreSQL deployment in a production environment. It should be used only for development purposes and the persistence of the database is not guaranteed. In a production environment, it is recommended to use an external SQL database and to give this module only the connection details. In that case, the default PostgreSQL sidecar will not be deployed. You can provide the credentials for connecting Keycloak to an external SQL database as follows: module \"keycloak\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-keycloak.git?ref=\" cluster_name = local.cluster_name base_domain = format(\"%s.nip.io\", replace(module.ingress.external_ip, \".\", \"-\")) cluster_issuer = local.cluster_issuer argocd_namespace = module.argocd_bootstrap.argocd_namespace database = { vendor = \"mariadb | mssql | mysql | oracle | postgres\" host = \"\" username = \"\" password = \"\" } dependency_ids = { traefik = module.ingress.id cert-manager = module.cert-manager.id } } The official documentation provides more information about the supported database vendors. This module needs a working Argo CD, so at least it depends on module.argocd_bootstrap. Since there is an ingress deployed with this module, it needs to be deployed after Traefik so it depends on module.ingress.

This module allows you to have a working authentication provider for the DevOps Stack without having to configure Keycloak manually. Because the main use of this module is to have a working Keycloak instance in a development environment, it provides a sensible configuration with some secure enough defaults. However, it is not recommended to be used in a production environment. For that purpose, we recommend you simply use this module as an example. Take a look at the code and read the provider’s documentation to get an idea on how it can be used manage your Keycloak instance. After deploying Keycloak using the main module on this repository, first you need to add the provider configuration necessary on your root module: terraform { required_providers { keycloak = { source = \"mrparkers/keycloak\" } } } provider \"keycloak\" { client_id = \"admin-cli\" username = module.keycloak.admin_credentials.username password = module.keycloak.admin_credentials.password url = \"https://keycloak.apps.${local.cluster_name}.${format(\"%s.nip.io\", replace(module.ingress.external_ip, \".\", \"-\"))}\" initial_login = false # Do no try to setup the provider before Keycloak is provisioned. tls_insecure_skip_verify = true # Since we are in a testing environment, do not verify the authenticity of SSL certificates. } The argument initial_login absolutely needs to be set as false, otherwise Terraform will try to connect to Keycloak before it is deployed. The argument tls_insecure_skip_verify needs to be set as false only on testing environments, when using self-signed SSL certificates. After setting up the provider, you can then bootstrap the authentication configuration like this: module \"oidc\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-keycloak.git//oidc_bootstrap?ref=\" cluster_name = local.cluster_name base_domain = format(\"%s.nip.io\", replace(module.ingress.external_ip, \".\", \"-\")) dependency_ids = { keycloak = module.keycloak.id } } By default, the oicd_bootstrap module creates a basic realm containing a placeholder user that you can use out-of-the-box to authenticate to the other applications on the DevOps Stack. However, you can provide a map of desired users and the submodule creates them all with an initial password that can then be changed. Simply declare the module as follows: module \"oidc\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-keycloak.git//oidc_bootstrap?ref=\" cluster_name = local.cluster_name base_domain = format(\"%s.nip.io\", replace(module.ingress.external_ip, \".\", \"-\")) user_map = { johndoe = { username = \"johndoe\" first_name = \"John\" last_name = \"Doe\" email = \"john.doe@example.com\" } janedoe = { username = \"janedoe\" first_name = \"Jane\" last_name = \"Doe\" email = \"jane.doe@example.com\" } } dependency_ids = { keycloak = module.keycloak.id } } All the fields on each user are required. Besides, since the e-mail is a scope required by most of our apps, the e-mail is automatically set as verified when the users are created. All users will belong to the administrators group and will have high privileges in applications such as Argo CD and MinIO. The module contains an output called devops_stack_users_passwords where you can get a map containing every username and their respective initial password. By default, the OIDC client is configured to allow returning to any URL after the authentication is successful. If you prefer, you can restrict only the redirect URIs to a list of domains using the input variable oidc_redirect_uris: module \"oidc\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-keycloak.git//oidc_bootstrap?ref=\" cluster_name = local.cluster_name base_domain = format(\"%s.nip.io\", replace(module.ingress.external_ip, \".\", \"-\")) oidc_redirec_uris = [ \"https://argocd.apps.${local.cluster_name}.${format(\"%s.nip.io\", replace(module.ingress.external_ip, \".\", \"-\"))}/auth/callback\", \"https://grafana.apps.${local.cluster_name}.${format(\"%s.nip.io\", replace(module.ingress.external_ip, \".\", \"-\"))}/login/generic_oauth\", \"https://prometheus.apps.${local.cluster_name}.${format(\"%s.nip.io\", replace(module.ingress.external_ip, \".\", \"-\"))}/oauth2/callback\", \"https://thanos-query.apps.${local.cluster_name}.${format(\"%s.nip.io\", replace(module.ingress.external_ip, \".\", \"-\"))}/oauth2/callback\", \"https://thanos-bucketweb.apps.${local.cluster_name}.${format(\"%s.nip.io\", replace(module.ingress.external_ip, \".\", \"-\"))}/oauth2/callback\", \"https://alertmanager.apps.${local.cluster_name}.${format(\"%s.nip.io\", replace(module.ingress.external_ip, \".\", \"-\"))}/oauth2/callback\", ] dependency_ids = { keycloak = module.keycloak.id } } The module provides and output called oidc containing the OIDC configuration that is to be passed on to other modules. This output is an object that outputs the content of local.oidc: locals { oidc = { issuer_url = format(\"https://keycloak.apps.%s.%s/realms/devops-stack\", var.cluster_name, var.base_domain) oauth_url = format(\"https://keycloak.apps.%s.%s/realms/devops-stack/protocol/openid-connect/auth\", var.cluster_name, var.base_domain) token_url = format(\"https://keycloak.apps.%s.%s/realms/devops-stack/protocol/openid-connect/token\", var.cluster_name, var.base_domain) api_url = format(\"https://keycloak.apps.%s.%s/realms/devops-stack/protocol/openid-connect/userinfo\", var.cluster_name, var.base_domain) client_id = \"devops-stack-applications\" client_secret = resource.random_password.client_secret.result oauth2_proxy_extra_args = var.cluster_issuer == \"ca-issuer\" ? [ \"--insecure-oidc-skip-issuer-verification=true\", \"--ssl-insecure-skip-verify=true\", ] : [] } } Obviously, this module must be deployed after module.keycloak, because it needs a working Keycloak instance where to create its resources.

This module can be declared by adding the following block on your Terraform configuration: module \"kube-prometheus-stack\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-kube-prometheus-stack//sks?ref=\" cluster_name = module.sks.cluster_name base_domain = module.sks.base_domain cluster_issuer = local.cluster_issuer argocd_namespace = module.argocd_bootstrap.argocd_namespace prometheus = { oidc = module.oidc.oidc } alertmanager = { oidc = module.oidc.oidc } grafana = { oidc = module.oidc.oidc } dependency_ids = { argocd = module.argocd_bootstrap.id traefik = module.traefik.id cert-manager = module.cert-manager.id keycloak = module.keycloak.id oidc = module.oidc.id longhorn = module.longhorn.id loki-stack = module.loki-stack.id } } When also deploying Thanos in the same cluster, you need to configure the metrics_storage variable with the values of the bucket created for the Thanos module. This will automatically activate the Thanos sidecar in the Prometheus pods as well as defining Thanos as the default data source for Grafana. module \"kube-prometheus-stack\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-kube-prometheus-stack//sks?ref=\" cluster_name = module.sks.cluster_name base_domain = module.sks.base_domain cluster_issuer = local.cluster_issuer argocd_namespace = module.argocd_bootstrap.argocd_namespace metrics_storage = { bucket_name = resource.aws_s3_bucket.this[\"thanos\"].id region = resource.aws_s3_bucket.this[\"thanos\"].region access_key = resource.exoscale_iam_access_key.s3_iam_key[\"thanos\"].key secret_key = resource.exoscale_iam_access_key.s3_iam_key[\"thanos\"].secret } prometheus = { oidc = module.oidc.oidc } alertmanager = { oidc = module.oidc.oidc } grafana = { oidc = module.oidc.oidc } dependency_ids = { argocd = module.argocd_bootstrap.id traefik = module.traefik.id cert-manager = module.cert-manager.id keycloak = module.keycloak.id oidc = module.oidc.id longhorn = module.longhorn.id loki-stack = module.loki-stack.id } } Check the SKS deployment example to see how to create the S3 bucket and to better understand the values passed on the example above. This module was developed with OIDC in mind. There is an OIDC proxy container deployed as a sidecar on the pods of Prometheus and Alertmanager. As such, the prometheus and alertmanager variables are expected to have a map oidc containing at least the Issuer URL, the Client ID, and the Client Secret. As for Grafana, the OIDC configuration is done through the grafana variable. The oidc map is expected to contain the same values as for Prometheus and Alertmanager, but also the oauth_url, token_url and api_url values. You can pass these values by pointing an output from another module (as above), or by defining them explicitly: module \"kube-prometheus-stack\" { ... prometheus | alertmanager = { oidc = { issuer_url = \"\" client_id = \"\" client_secret = \"\" } } grafana = { oidc = { issuer_url = \"\" client_id = \"\" client_secret = \"\" oauth_url = \"\" token_url = \"\" api_url = \"\" } } ... } Obviously, the module depends on an already running Argo CD in the cluster in order for the application to be created. This module has multiple ingresses and consequently it must be deployed after the module traefik and cert-manager. When using Keycloak as an OIDC provider for the Longhorn Dashboard, you need to add Keycloak and the OIDC module as dependencies. This module requires a Persistent Volume so it needs to be deployed after the module Longhorn. In order to be able to check the logs collected by Loki in the Grafana interface, this module requires to be deployed after the module Loki, so it can detect it as a data source.

The Longhorn chart used by this module is shipped in this repository as well, in order to avoid any unwanted behaviors caused by unsupported versions. Current Chart Version Original Repository Default Values 1.7.0 Chart values.yaml For the moment, this module only supports the deployment of Longhorn in SKS clusters. A simple declaration of the module would look like this: module \"longhorn\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-longhorn.git?ref=\" cluster_name = module.sks.cluster_name base_domain = module.sks.base_domain cluster_issuer = local.cluster_issuer argocd_namespace = module.argocd_bootstrap.argocd_namespace dependency_ids = { argocd = module.argocd_bootstrap.id } } You can enable the ingress to the Longhorn Dashboard. In that case, you will need to enable the respective flag and pass along the required OIDC configuration: module \"longhorn\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-longhorn.git?ref=\" cluster_name = module.sks.cluster_name base_domain = module.sks.base_domain cluster_issuer = local.cluster_issuer argocd_namespace = module.argocd_bootstrap.argocd_namespace enable_dashboard_ingress = true oidc = module.oidc.oidc dependency_ids = { argocd = module.argocd_bootstrap.id traefik = module.traefik.id cert-manager = module.cert-manager.id keycloak = module.keycloak.id oidc = module.oidc.id } The previous example uses Keycloak as an OIDC provider, but you can use any other you want. In case you want to backup the content of the persistent volumes, you have the possibility of enabling the backup feature. In that case, you will need to enable the respective flag and pass along the require S3 configuration: module \"longhorn\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-longhorn.git?ref=\" cluster_name = module.sks.cluster_name base_domain = module.sks.base_domain cluster_issuer = local.cluster_issuer argocd_namespace = module.argocd_bootstrap.argocd_namespace enable_dashboard_ingress = true oidc = module.oidc.oidc enable_pv_backups = true backup_storage = { bucket_name = resource.aws_s3_bucket.this[\"longhorn\"].id region = resource.aws_s3_bucket.this[\"longhorn\"].region endpoint = \"sos-${resource.aws_s3_bucket.this[\"longhorn\"].region}.exo.io\" access_key = resource.exoscale_iam_access_key.s3_iam_key[\"longhorn\"].key secret_key = resource.exoscale_iam_access_key.s3_iam_key[\"longhorn\"].secret } dependency_ids = { argocd = module.argocd_bootstrap.id traefik = module.traefik.id cert-manager = module.cert-manager.id keycloak = module.keycloak.id oidc = module.oidc.id } You are in charge of creating the S3 bucket to store the PV backups. We’ve decided to keep the creation of this bucket outside of this module, mainly because the persistence of the data should not be related to the instantiation of the module itself. Check the SKS deployment example to see how to create the S3 bucket and to better understand the values passed on the example above. On the technical reference below you will find further customization options, such as the backup/snapshot schedule. If there is a need to configure something besides the common settings that we have provided, you can customize the chart’s values.yaml by adding an Helm configuration as an HCL structure: module \"longhorn\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-longhorn.git?ref=\" cluster_name = module.sks.cluster_name base_domain = module.sks.base_domain cluster_issuer = local.cluster_issuer argocd_namespace = module.argocd_bootstrap.argocd_namespace enable_dashboard_ingress = true oidc = module.oidc.oidc enable_pv_backups = true backup_storage = { bucket_name = resource.aws_s3_bucket.this[\"longhorn\"].id region = resource.aws_s3_bucket.this[\"longhorn\"].region endpoint = \"sos-${resource.aws_s3_bucket.this[\"longhorn\"].region}.exo.io\" access_key = resource.exoscale_iam_access_key.s3_iam_key[\"longhorn\"].key secret_key = resource.exoscale_iam_access_key.s3_iam_key[\"longhorn\"].secret } helm_values = [{ # Note the curly brackets here longhorn = { map = { string = \"string\" bool = true } sequence = [ { key1 = \"value1\" key2 = \"value2\" }, { key1 = \"value1\" key2 = \"value2\" }, ] sequence2 = [ \"string1\", \"string2\" ] } }] dependency_ids = { argocd = module.argocd_bootstrap.id traefik = module.traefik.id cert-manager = module.cert-manager.id keycloak = module.keycloak.id oidc = module.oidc.id } There is an OAuth2-Proxy container deployed along with the Longhorn dashboard. Consequently, the oidc variable is expected to have at least the Issuer URL, the Client ID, and the Client Secret. You can pass these values by pointing an output from another module (as above), or by defining them explicitly: module \"longhorn\" { ... oidc = { issuer_url = \"\" client_id = \"\" client_secret = \"\" } ... } If your pod and his volume are still up, start by shuting down the pod (be careful to also stop the Deployment/StatefulSet) and delete the volume using the Longhorn Dashboard. Go to the backup tab of Longhorn Dashboard and restore the desired volume backup. You must check the Use Previous Name checkbox in order to keep the old volume name. Next, go to the volume tab, select your newly restored volume and choose Create PV/PVC option. Select Use Previous PVC option and validate. You can now restore your application, which should attach the restored volume automatically. This module must be one of the first ones to be deployed, since other modules require Persistent Volumes. Consequently it needs to be deployed right after the module argocd_bootstrap. This is the only dependency that is not optional. When enabling the ingress for the Longhorn Dashboard, you need to add Traefik and cert-manager as dependencies. When using Keycloak as an OIDC provider for the Longhorn Dashboard, you need to add Keycloak and the OIDC module as dependencies.

AWS Cognito will take the user’s e-mail addresses to send a temporary password in clear text, so these addresses need to be valid. For now, we devised this user creation in the code mainly as a way to bootstrap ephemeral clusters used for testing. To do this, you need to populate the user_map variable with an object for each user: module \"oidc\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-oidc-aws-cognito.git?ref=\" cluster_name = module.eks.cluster_name base_domain = module.eks.base_domain create_pool = true user_map = { johndoe = { username = \"johndoe\" first_name = \"John\" last_name = \"Doe\" email = \"john.doe@example.com\" } janedoe = { username = \"janedoe\" first_name = \"Jane\" last_name = \"Doe\" email = \"jane.doe@example.com\" } } } Only the username and e-mail fields on each user are required. Besides, since the e-mail is a scope required by most of our apps, the e-mail is automatically set as verified when the users are created. All users will belong to the administrators group and will have high privileges in applications such as Argo CD. The module contains an output called devops_stack_admins where you can get a map containing every username and their respective e-mail. By default, the OIDC client is configured to allow returning to the canonical URLs of the default DevOps Stack applications. You can however use the variable callback_urls if you want to add any other callback URLs for the OIDC client: module \"oidc\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-oidc-aws-cognito.git?ref=\" cluster_name = module.eks.cluster_name base_domain = module.eks.base_domain cognito_user_pool_id = resource.aws_oidc_pool.pool.id cognito_user_pool_domain = resource.aws_cognito_user_pool_domain.pool_domain.domain callback_urls = [ \"https://callback1.url/oauth/callback\", \"https://callback2.url/login/generic_oauth\", ] } The module provides and output called oidc containing the OIDC configuration that is to be passed on to other modules.

This module can be declared by adding the following block on your Terraform configuration: module \"thanos\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-thanos.git//aks?ref=\" cluster_name = TODO base_domain = TODO cluster_issuer = local.cluster_issuer argocd_namespace = module.argocd_bootstrap.argocd_namespace metrics_storage = { container = azurerm_storage_container.thanos.name storage_account = azurerm_storage_account.thanos.name storage_account_key = azurerm_storage_account.thanos.primary_access_key } thanos = { oidc = module.oidc.oidc } dependency_ids = { argocd = module.argocd_bootstrap.id traefik = module.traefik.id cert-manager = module.cert-manager.id } } As you can see, a minimum requirement for this module is an Azure Blob Storage bucket and an OIDC provider (more information below). You are in charge of creating an Azure Blob Storage for Thanos to store the archived metrics. We’ve decided to keep the creation of this bucket outside of this module, mainly because the persistence of the data should not be related to the instantiation of the module itself. Check the AKS deployment example to see how to create the storage and to better understand the values passed on the example above. Do not forget that the bucket configuration also needs to be passed to the module kube-prometheus-stack. Although the declaration above allows you to have a barebones Thanos deployed, it is highly recommended that you customize a few settings for a production-ready deployment. You need to at least configure the resource requirements for a few of the Thanos' components and the size of the persistent volume used by the compactor. You can also configure the compactor retention times, as in the example below. module \"thanos\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-thanos.git//aks?ref=\" cluster_name = TODO base_domain = TODO cluster_issuer = local.cluster_issuer argocd_namespace = module.argocd_bootstrap.argocd_namespace metrics_storage = { container = azurerm_storage_container.thanos.name storage_account = azurerm_storage_account.thanos.name storage_account_key = azurerm_storage_account.thanos.primary_access_key } thanos = { # OIDC configuration oidc = module.oidc.oidc # Configuration of the persistent volume for the compactor compactor_persistent_size = \"100Gi\" # Resources configuration for the pods compactor_resources = { limits = { memory = \"1Gi\" } requests = { cpu = \"0.5\" memory = \"512Mi\" } } storegateway_resources = { limits = { memory = \"1Gi\" } requests = { cpu = \"0.5\" memory = \"1Gi\" } } query_resources = { limits = { memory = \"1Gi\" } requests = { cpu = \"0.5\" memory = \"512Mi\" } } # Retention settings for the compactor compactor_retention = { raw = \"60d\" five_min = \"120d\" one_hour = \"240d\" } } depends_on = [module.argocd_bootstrap] } As you can see on the examples above, the variable thanos provides an interface to customize the most frequently used settings. This variable is merged with the local value thanos_defaults, which contains some sensible defaults to have a barebones working deployment. You can check the default values on the local.tf file. If there is a need to configure something besides the common settings that we have provided above, you can customize the chart’s values.yaml by adding an Helm configuration as an HCL structure: module \"thanos\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-thanos.git//aks?ref=\" cluster_name = TODO base_domain = TODO cluster_issuer = local.cluster_issuer argocd_namespace = module.argocd_bootstrap.argocd_namespace metrics_storage = { container = azurerm_storage_container.thanos.name storage_account = azurerm_storage_account.thanos.name storage_account_key = azurerm_storage_account.thanos.primary_access_key } thanos = { oidc = module.oidc.oidc } helm_values = [{ # Note the curly brackets here thanos = { map = { string = \"string\" bool = true } sequence = [ { key1 = \"value1\" key2 = \"value2\" }, { key1 = \"value1\" key2 = \"value2\" }, ] sequence2 = [ \"string1\", \"string2\" ] } }] depends_on = [module.argocd_bootstrap] } This module was developed with OIDC in mind. There is an OIDC proxy container deployed as a sidecar on each pod that has a web interface. Consequently, the thanos variable is expected to have a map oidc containing at least the Issuer URL, the Client ID, and the Client Secret. You can pass these values by pointing an output from another module (as above), or by defining them explicitly: module \"thanos\" { ... thanos = { oidc = { issuer_url = \"\" client_id = \"\" client_secret = \"\" } } ... } Since the resource requirements are not the same on every deployment and because the consumed resources also influence the cost associated, we refrained from configuring default resource requirements for the components of Thanos. We did, however, set memory limits for some of the pods (query, storegateway and compactor all have a 1 GB memory limit). We recommend that you customize these values as you see fit. At the very least you should configure the size for the PersistentVolume used by the compactor. This value MUST be configured otherwise the compactor will NOT work on a production deployment. The Thanos documentation recommends a size of 100-300 GB. Obviously, the module depends on an already running Argo CD in the cluster in order for the application to be created.

This module can be declared by adding the following block on your Terraform configuration: module \"thanos\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-thanos.git//eks?ref=\" cluster_name = module.eks.cluster_name base_domain = module.eks.base_domain cluster_issuer = local.cluster_issuer argocd_namespace = module.argocd_bootstrap.argocd_namespace metrics_storage = { bucket_id = resource.aws_s3_bucket.thanos_metrics_storage.id create_role = true cluster_oidc_issuer_url = module.eks.cluster_oidc_issuer_url } thanos = { oidc = module.oidc.oidc } dependency_ids = { argocd = module.argocd_bootstrap.id traefik = module.traefik.id cert-manager = module.cert-manager.id oidc = module.oidc.id } } As you can see, a minimum requirement for this module is an S3 bucket and an OIDC provider (more information below). IMPORTANT You are in charge of creating a S3 bucket for Thanos to store the archived metrics. We’ve decided to keep the creation of this bucket outside of this module, mainly because the persistence of the data should not be related to the instantiation of the module itself. However, the IAM role used to give permissions to the Thanos components to access the bucket can be created by the module itself. If you want to create the role, you can set the attribute create_role to true and the module will create the role for you. If you already have a role created, you can pass the ARN of the role to the module using the attribute iam_role_arn. Check the EKS deployment example to see how to create the S3 bucket and to better understand the values passed on the example above. Do not forget that the bucket configuration also needs to be passed to the module kube-prometheus-stack. Although the declaration above allows you to have a barebones Thanos deployed, it is highly recommended that you customize a few settings for a production-ready deployment. You need to at least configure the resource requirements for a few of the Thanos' components and the size of the persistent volume used by the compactor. You can also configure the compactor retention times, as in the example below. module \"thanos\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-thanos.git//eks?ref=\" cluster_name = module.eks.cluster_name base_domain = module.eks.base_domain cluster_issuer = local.cluster_issuer argocd_namespace = module.argocd_bootstrap.argocd_namespace metrics_storage = { bucket_id = resource.aws_s3_bucket.thanos_metrics_storage.id create_role = true cluster_oidc_issuer_url = module.eks.cluster_oidc_issuer_url } thanos = { # OIDC configuration oidc = module.oidc.oidc # Configuration of the persistent volume for the compactor compactor_persistent_size = \"100Gi\" # Resources configuration for the pods compactor_resources = { limits = { memory = \"1Gi\" } requests = { cpu = \"0.5\" memory = \"512Mi\" } } storegateway_resources = { limits = { memory = \"1Gi\" } requests = { cpu = \"0.5\" memory = \"1Gi\" } } query_resources = { limits = { memory = \"1Gi\" } requests = { cpu = \"0.5\" memory = \"512Mi\" } } # Retention settings for the compactor compactor_retention = { raw = \"60d\" five_min = \"120d\" one_hour = \"240d\" } } dependency_ids = { argocd = module.argocd_bootstrap.id traefik = module.traefik.id cert-manager = module.cert-manager.id oidc = module.oidc.id } } As you can see on the examples above, the variable thanos provides an interface to customize the most frequently used settings. This variable is merged with the local value thanos_defaults, which contains some sensible defaults to have a barebones working deployment. You can check the default values on the local.tf file. If there is a need to configure something besides the common settings that we have provided above, you can customize the chart’s values.yaml by adding an Helm configuration as an HCL structure: module \"thanos\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-thanos.git//eks?ref=\" cluster_name = module.eks.cluster_name base_domain = module.eks.base_domain cluster_issuer = local.cluster_issuer argocd_namespace = module.argocd_bootstrap.argocd_namespace metrics_storage = { bucket_id = resource.aws_s3_bucket.thanos_metrics_storage.id create_role = true cluster_oidc_issuer_url = module.eks.cluster_oidc_issuer_url } thanos = { oidc = module.oidc.oidc } helm_values = [{ # Note the curly brackets here thanos = { map = { string = \"string\" bool = true } sequence = [ { key1 = \"value1\" key2 = \"value2\" }, { key1 = \"value1\" key2 = \"value2\" }, ] sequence2 = [ \"string1\", \"string2\" ] } }] dependency_ids = { argocd = module.argocd_bootstrap.id traefik = module.traefik.id cert-manager = module.cert-manager.id oidc = module.oidc.id } } Thanos needs an S3 bucket to store the archived metrics. The bucket can be created and its ID should be passed to the module, along with the attribute create_role explicitly set. Set it to true if you want the module to create the required IAM role. However, if you want to create and manage this IAM role yourself, you can simply pass the ARN of the role to the module using the attribute iam_role_arn while setting the attribute create_role to false. The code in this example should help you create the IAM policy and role with the required permissions. This module was developed with OIDC in mind. There is an OIDC proxy container deployed as a sidecar on each pod that has a web interface. Consequently, the thanos variable is expected to have a map oidc containing at least the Issuer URL, the Client ID, and the Client Secret. You can pass these values by pointing an output from another module (as above), or by defining them explicitly: module \"thanos\" { ... thanos = { oidc = { issuer_url = \"\" client_id = \"\" client_secret = \"\" } } ... } Since the resource requirements are not the same on every deployment and because the consumed resources also influence the cost associated, we refrained from configuring default resource requirements for the components of Thanos. We did, however, set memory limits for some of the pods (query, storegateway and compactor all have a 1 GB memory limit). We recommend that you customize these values as you see fit. At the very least you should configure the size for the Persistent Volume used by the compactor. This value MUST be configured otherwise the compactor will NOT work on a production deployment. The Thanos documentation recommends a size of 100-300 GB. Obviously, the module depends on an already running Argo CD in the cluster in order for the application to be created. This module has multiple ingresses and consequently it must be deployed after the module traefik and cert-manager. You need to add the OIDC module as a dependency, since OAuth2-Proxy is deployed to restrict access to the web interfaces of the components. The following requirements are needed by this module: argocd (>= 5) null (>= 3) random (>= 3) utils (>= 1) The following providers are used by this module: aws The following Modules are called: Source: terraform-aws-modules/iam/aws//modules/iam-assumable-role-with-oidc Version: ~> 5.0 Source: ../ Version: The following resources are used by this module: aws_iam_policy.thanos (resource) aws_iam_policy_document.thanos (data source) aws_s3_bucket.thanos (data source) The following input variables are required: Description: AWS S3 bucket configuration values for the bucket where the archived metrics will be stored.

If there is a need to configure something besides the common settings that we have provided, you can customize the chart’s values.yaml by adding an Helm configuration as an HCL structure: module \"thanos\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-thanos//kind?ref=\" cluster_name = local.cluster_name base_domain = local.base_domain cluster_issuer = local.cluster_issuer argocd_namespace = module.argocd_bootstrap.argocd_namespace metrics_storage = { bucket_name = local.minio_config.buckets.1.name endpoint = module.minio.endpoint access_key = local.minio_config.users.1.accessKey secret_key = local.minio_config.users.1.secretKey } thanos = { oidc = module.oidc.oidc } helm_values = [{ # Note the curly brackets here thanos = { map = { string = \"string\" bool = true } sequence = [ { key1 = \"value1\" key2 = \"value2\" }, { key1 = \"value1\" key2 = \"value2\" }, ] sequence2 = [ \"string1\", \"string2\" ] } }] dependency_ids = { argocd = module.argocd_bootstrap.id traefik = module.traefik.id cert-manager = module.cert-manager.id minio = module.minio.id keycloak = module.keycloak.id oidc = module.oidc.id } } This module was developed with OIDC in mind. There is an OIDC proxy container deployed as a sidecar on each pod that has a web interface. Consequently, the thanos variable is expected to have a map oidc containing at least the Issuer URL, the Client ID, and the Client Secret. You can pass these values by pointing an output from another module (as above), or by defining them explicitly: module \"thanos\" { ... thanos = { oidc = { issuer_url = \"\" client_id = \"\" client_secret = \"\" } } ... } Since the resource requirements are not the same on every deployment and because the consumed resources also influence the cost associated, we refrained from configuring default resource requirements for the components of Thanos. We did, however, set memory limits for some of the pods (query, storegateway and compactor all have a 1 GB memory limit). These values should be customized as you see fit, although there is not really a need in a test deployment. Obviously, the module depends on an already running Argo CD in the cluster in order for the application to be created. This module has multiple ingresses and consequently it must be deployed after the module traefik and cert-manager. When using Keycloak as an OIDC provider for the Longhorn Dashboard, you need to add Keycloak and the OIDC module as dependencies. This module requires a S3 bucket to store the metrics so it needs to be deployed after the module MinIO. The following requirements are needed by this module: argocd (>= 5) null (>= 3) random (>= 3) utils (>= 1) The following Modules are called: Source: ../ Version: The following input variables are required: Description: MinIO S3 bucket configuration values for the bucket where the archived metrics will be stored.
